## New features from the previous month

* We've started testing our machine-learning powered
  [contextual niche targeting]({filename}../pages/niche-targeting.md)
  with a small test of a couple advertisers.
  So far, the results are pretty promising and we've been able to significantly increase
  the inventory available for some mid-sized developer niches
  (think advertisers interested in two factor auth).
* We released our [Q4 advertiser prospectus](https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf).
  The biggest changes were some more details on niche targeting, a modest price increase in North America and a smaller one in Western Europe, and highlighting the ability
  for advertisers to target a wide geographic cross-section with a ["run of network"]({filename}../pages/advertisers-pricing.md) campaign.
* We released a new feature Google Sheets export feature to help advertisers
  who view their ad metrics (impressions/clicks/spend) in auto-updating dashboards.
  We are testing this with a few advertisers who had asked for such features
  but if you're interested in this, please [get in touch]({filename}../pages/contact.md).
* After some more testing, we are pretty happy with the
  [ad rotation](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#automatic-ad-rotation)
  features we built for our ad client. We're continuing to iterate there, but we are seeing
  good engagement without a significant dip in performance.

You can always see our latest server updates in our
[ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html)
and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## September advertising stats

[comment]: https://server.ethicalads.io/publisher/all/report/?start_date=2024-09-01&end_date=2024-09-30

Last month:

* We generated **$46,048.59** for our publishers and they'll receive this payout next Tuesday.
* We had **179 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **20,334,175** paid ad views across the world.
  This is among the highest it's ever been and our new run of network options
  are allowing us to sell a larger percentage of our traffic especially in regions
  that were historically undersold.

We continue to be sold out in our core markets.
If you run a high-quality developer-focused site
or have a free (ad supported) version of a developer-focused product
and you'd like to monetize with ads,

## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap for October:

* We are releasing a new onboarding improvement to email advertisers
  when they launch their first campaign.
  The goal is to help them with onboarding new advertisers,
  pointing them toward the reporting they want,
  and generally help with navigating our platform.
* While we review all the publisher payouts before they go out on the 15th of the month,
  we have fully automated payouts for publishers using Stripe.
  Next week's payouts will be the true test of this.
* We're aiming to have a content piece with where to spend your first marketing dollar
  as a startup (hint: we're a bit better for your 5,000th dollar than the first).


Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
Please [let us know]({filename}../pages/contact.md) if you have any ideas or feedback on our product or roadmap,
