## New features from April

* We did a wider demo and tech explanation of our
  [page similarity]({filename}../pages/similar-pages.md?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mongodb.com%2Fatlas)
  features that will help us target small audiences by matching pages where our ads appear directly
  with advertiser landing pages.
  The integration into our ad targeting is still being worked on and should be released later this month
  or early June.
* We released a UX improvement for advertisers to let them more easily and quickly
  compare campaigns on a CTR and eCPC basis.
* We had a content piece exploring the trade-offs publishers make and why
  [some pages have more ads than content]({filename}../posts/2024-minimalist-ads.md).


You can always see our latest server updates in our
[ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html)
and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## April advertising stats

[comment]: https://server.ethicalads.io/publisher/all/report/?start_date=2024-04-01&end_date=2024-04-30

In April 2024:

* We generated **$34,269.56** for our publishers.
* We had **179 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **14,605,508** paid ad views across the world.

April was not a particularly strong month for us due to a few advertisers pulling back simultaneously.
However, the latter half of the month was much better and while May isn't shaping up to be stellar,
it looks much better than April.


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap for May:

* We are going to do a marketing blog post to go along with our
  [tech blog]({filename}../posts/2024-niche-ad-targeting.md)
  about the new similar pages/niche targeting functionality.
* We are building some additional integrations to get better niche targeting
  using the same embeddings features and use it directly in our ad serving.
* We are working on some additional testimonials around the "agency-lite"
  features we provide to advertisers to help ensure their campaigns are successful.

Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
Please [let us know]({filename}../pages/contact.md) if you have any ideas or feedback on our product or roadmap,
we always love to hear from you.
