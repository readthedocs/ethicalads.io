We've discussed before the drawbacks to surveillance advertising and other invasive ad-tech practices.
But what's the alternative?


## User Targeting vs Content Targeting

After Google announced that it will not implement any alternative user-level identifiers to replace third-party cookies,
marketers around the world began evaluating just how important this ability to target individuals is to their strategy.
One marketing company Invoca was actually glad to hear the news. Their CEO Gregg Johnson said on [the topic](https://www.invoca.com/blog/tracking-cookies-are-dead-what-marketers-can-do-about-it),
“For years, marketers have been addicted to using third-party data,
but it wasn’t because third-party data was the most effective way to reach their target customers.
Actually, it was because that data was just so easy for them to access and execute short-term campaigns."

So if user-level targeting isn't the most effective way to reach your target customers, what is?
Instead of targeting individuals by storing their device information and IP adresses,
we target our ads based on the content of the page. Also known as **content targeting**. But does it *work*?

## What our data says

Our CTR (click through rate) is consistently higher on campaigns which employ topic targeting in addition to geographic targeting.
