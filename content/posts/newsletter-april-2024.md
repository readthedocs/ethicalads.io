## New features from March

* We shipped an updated version of our [publisher guide]({filename}../pages/publisher-guide.md)
  with simplified graphics and explainers about what we expect from publishers
  and how they can get the most out of EthicalAds.
* We released a new [advertiser pricing page]({filename}../pages/advertisers-pricing.md).
  While our pricing was always upfront, we think having a dedicated pricing page
  in our core navigation will help us set the tone for how we're upfront and transparent with advertisers.
* We're continuing to make progress on our
  [machine learning based niche targeting]({filename}../posts/2022-content-based-targeting.md).
  These changes will let us target a lot of smaller audiences that were previously too hard or too small to target.
  We're going to do a bigger launch with blogs and social media explaining this change in April,
  but you can see a technology demo where we show the ability to find similar pages to an advertiser's product or landing page [here]({filename}../pages/similar-pages.md?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mongodb.com%2Fatlas).


You can always see our latest server updates in our
[ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html)
and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## March advertising stats

[comment]: https://server.ethicalads.io/publisher/all/report/?start_date=2024-03-01&end_date=2024-03-31

In March 2024:

* We generated **$44,375.69** for our publishers.
* We had **177 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **17,592,121** paid ad views across the world.

March was a very strong month but we're seeing a little softness in early April.
Some of this may be seasonality but we're seeing some established advertisers
pulling back in April.


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap for April:

* As I highlighted above, we're aiming for a bigger launch for our niche targeting features
  including blog posts and working them into our actual ad serving algorithms.
* We are continuing to work on some UX improvements for advertisers
  including better ways to compare campaigns with different prices and CTR on an eCPC basis.
* We aim to release an improvement to our ad rotation features we were working on a few months back.
  Specifically, we are going to try rotating an ad when somebody backgrounds a tab and returns
  to it after a certain amount of time. This kind of change requires some trial and error
  and testing to make sure performance stays as good or gets better,
  but we're excited to keep iterating on ad rotation to make our network better for publishers.

Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
Please [let us know]({filename}../pages/contact.md) if you have any ideas or feedback on our product or roadmap,
we always love to hear from you.
