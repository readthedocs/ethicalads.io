We're excited to announce a partnership with the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.pythoneorg/psf/) (PSF).
EthicalAds is now powering their sponsor promotion across their ecosystem of web properties.


## The problem

The PSF was looking for a way to promote their sponsors from a single platform,
but across a large number of properties.
They found that EthicalAds was a great solution for this,
since we have a simple javascript client, as well as an API for more complex integrations in the future. 
The PSF also wanted to keep track of how many times each sponsor image has been seen and viewed.
This would allow them to help quantify the value they are delivering their sponsors.

## The solution

The initial implementation has been the javascript client,
since the web properties are easy to integrate into our existing products.
They started with the sites that are already included in their sponsorship prospectus.
The properties we are currently implementing sponsorship on are:

* The [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/1.26.7/#changes)
* The [PSF sponsor listing page](https://www.python.org/psf/sponsors/)

You can see the PyPI integration looks similar to our normal ad placements,
whereas the PSF sponsors page has a custom look and feel.
We are able to customize each of the placements used in our sponsorship platform,
so they can look exactly what you need.

> Weâ€™ve been really happy with EthicalAds for [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/1.26.7/#changes)! Indeed, things have settled and we're going to be starting work on using EA for other placements on python.org.

With the new ability to easily show sponsorship logos on all of their properties,
the PSF will be able to expand where sponsors are shown easily.
All of these different integrations are also able to provide view & click statistics,
without requiring any cookies by the user. 

## Get your own sponsorship solution

We're excited about implementing new features on our sponsorship offering,
and working with you to try it out.
If you'd like to create a similar program,
you can sign up for our [sponsorship platform](https://www.ethicalads.io/sponsorship-platform/).
