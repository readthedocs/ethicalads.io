We're excited to announce a partnership with the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.pythoneorg/psf/).
EthicalAds is now powering their sponsor promotion across their ecosystem of web properties,
helping them deliver value to their sponsors.

## The problem

The PSF was looking for a way to promote their sponsors across a number of web properties,
but have a single management and reporting mechanism.
EthicalAds was a great solution for this,
since we have a simple javascript client facilitate the sponsorship displays.
The PSF also wanted to keep track of how many times each sponsor image has been seen and viewed.
Having metrics allows them to quantify the value they are delivering their sponsors.

## The solution

The PSF started with the sites that are already included in their sponsorship prospectus.
They were able to integrate our ad client,
and manage the targeting on the backend of our ad server.
The properties we are currently implementing sponsorship on are:

* The [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/1.26.7/#changes)
* The [PSF sponsor listing page](https://www.python.org/psf/sponsors/)

You can see the PyPI integration looks similar to our normal ad placements,
whereas the PSF sponsors page has a custom look and feel.
We are able to customize each of the placements used in our sponsorship platform.

> We’re happy to use EthicalAds for sponsor recognition across our web properties with centralized management and respect for privacy.

With the new ability to show sponsorship logos on all of their properties,
the PSF will be able to expand where sponsors are shown.
All of these different integrations are also able to provide view & click statistics,
without requiring any cookies by the user.
