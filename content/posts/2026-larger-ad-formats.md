This month, we're launching a new, larger ad format.
We've heard from advertisers that our existing formats can sometimes feel too small
to fully tell their story. At the same time, some publishers have layouts that can comfortably support a larger placement, and they're looking for ways to earn more than our [standard formats]({filename}../pages/learning-hub/ad-design-and-specs.md) allow.

This new format is completely opt-in for both advertisers and publishers.
Advertisers can enable it as an add-on to an existing campaign,
while publishers only need to make a small change to how they request ads from us.
Nothing is being replaced or changed by default.
We're simply offering more flexibility and a new option for those who want it.

</div>


## Specs

The only differences from our [ad specs]({filename}../pages/learning-hub/ad-design-and-specs.md) are:

* The text can be up to 240 characters
* The logo, which is optional, should be a single color and is a 160x60 pixels.
  It needs to be a single color to accommodate both light and dark mode sites.


## Pricing

Initial pricing for this format is set at 2× our [standard ad rates]({filename}../pages/advertisers-pricing.md),
reflecting the increased size and prominence of the placement.
For publishers, this translates directly into **earning double** what they would from our standard ad formats.
Advertisers get the same high-quality contextual and geo-targeting they expect today but with more space to tell their story.


## Getting started

If you're a publisher interested in earning more from your existing inventory,
just send us a [support request](https://server.ethicalads.io/accounts/support/?subject=Larger+ad+format) and we'll walk you through the details.

If you're an advertiser, whether you're already running campaigns with us or considering your first one,
we'd love to help you [launch a campaign]({filename}../pages/advertisers.md#inbound-form) using this new, larger format.
