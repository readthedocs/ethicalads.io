## New features from the previous month

* We released a number of improvements to our analyzer that we use for [niche targeting]({filename}../pages/niche-targeting.md).
  By combining our approach with off-the-shelf embedding models, we were able to *significantly*
  increase the percent of our network that can be targeted with niche targeting and greatly increase our inventory
  for a number of niches.
* We released a new [prospectus for Q3]({static}../prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf).
  There were some small price increases primarily in North America to balance our demand.
  We are also releasing [pricing]({filename}../pages/advertisers-pricing.md) for niche targeting in more regions.
* I appeared on a [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VHtp_M93_8)
  with [Catchy](https://www.catchyagency.com/),
  a fantastic marketing agency we've worked with on a number of campaigns.
  We talked about developer marketing, ad blockers, and how AI will transform ad targeting and advertising generally.

## June advertising stats

[comment]: https://server.ethicalads.io/publisher/all/report/?start_date=2025-06-01&end_date=2025-06-30

Last month:

* We generated **$37,589.22** for our publishers and they'll receive this in a payout today.
  This was pretty similar with May.
* We had **181 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
  This has been slowly creeping up and we've been seeing strong demand for our kind of network from publishers.
* We had **18,357,814** paid ad views across the world. This was pretty flat compared with last month.

Demand seems to be extremely strong in North America which is why we enacted a small price increase there.
There are still some openings in Europe although there's been a lot of good campaigns there too.


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap for July:

* In July or early August, we hope to have a content piece explaining more about how we're using embedding models
  for niche targeting and how off-the-shelf LLMs can improve that.
* We're still making improvements constantly to our analyzer and to our niche targeting.
  This is going to be a big focus over the next few months.
* We have some styling improvements prepared on our ad client that publishers can use to better style ads
  on their site using CSS properties (here's the [PR](https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-client/pull/219)).
  This has been on the to-do list, and is nearly done.
