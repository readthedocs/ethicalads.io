## New features from the previous month

* We built a bulk importer to handle uploading ads in bulk.
  A couple advertisers asked for this to speed up the process
  when running multiple campaigns across different geo- or contextual targeting.
  This lets advertisers prepare ads in Google Sheets or Excel and import it.
* It's now possible to have lower-privilege accounts for advertisers and publishers
  who can view reports but not change any settings or ads.
* We added some [new variables]({filename}../pages/learning-hub/advertiser-guide.md#measuring-conversions)
  that advertisers can use in their landing page links and in UTM parameters.
  This lets advertisers capture the specific ad flight the ad was from
  as well as some other possibilities.

You can always see our latest server updates in our
[ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html)
and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## November advertising stats

[comment]: https://server.ethicalads.io/publisher/all/report/?start_date=2024-11-01&end_date=2024-11-30

Last month:

* We generated **$34,754.89** for our publishers and they'll receive this in a payout next week.
  This number is lower than it has been in recent months.
* We had **178 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **24,144,837** paid ad views across the world.
  This number is still pretty high but we are running a number of really broad,
  but low priced campaigns.

We are continuing to see weakness in our core markets.
We are continuing a discount we offered in November for new advertisers.
[Normally]({filename}../pages/advertisers-pricing.md) we offer discounts
for campaigns at $3k and $25k,
but instead we're offering them at $1k and $3k.
These are only available until our traffic is totally sold again.
If you're interested in running a campaign, [get in touch]({filename}../pages/advertisers.md#inbound-form)!


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap for December:


* We are beginning to experiment with some larger ad placements on publishers who want this.
  If you're an advertiser interested in a larger ad format,
  [let us know]({filename}../pages/advertisers.md#inbound-form).
* In addition to a report by publisher, we're building a report that breaks down advertiser traffic
  by the domain where the ad was shown. Quite a few advertisers asked for this.
* We will be releasing our new
  [prospectus]({static}../prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf)
  for Q1 in the next week.
* We're aiming to have a new ad format for sites that want a fixed header ad.


Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
Please [let us know]({filename}../pages/contact.md) if you have any ideas or feedback on our product or roadmap,
we always love to hear from you.
