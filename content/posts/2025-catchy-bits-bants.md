Long time friends of the network [Catchy](https://www.catchyagency.com) had me on their podcast Bits and Bants
to talk about developer marketing, adblockers, and how AI is and will continue to transform ad targeting and advertising more generally.

Catchy is a fantastic marketing agency really focused on reaching developers and getting results for their clients through both traditional and nontraditional channels. They've been great to work with on a number of campaigns.
