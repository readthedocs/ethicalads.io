description: The lie from ad tech is that there's no such thing as a premium publisher and all ad views are basically the same.

It used to be if you wanted to reach a particular group of people with your message
you’d buy ad space on a billboard where those people are likely to see it
or buy an ad spot in a newspaper section that your target market reads.
In the online world, this used to mean finding an online publication for your product
or buying up specific terms at search engines.
If you plan to introduce a new line of cat food?
You run an ad on [ModernCat.com](https://moderncat.com)
or you pay to take the top search engine result for "cat food".

With the rise of ad tech powered by personal data collection,
advertisers can reach cat lovers (or any targeted group)
by paying ad tech companies to show their ads wherever the audience goes.
Maybe you pay top dollar for ModernCat.com for a little while,
but after you've got cookies to track their visitors onto other sites,
you can reach the same folks on lower value channels more cheaply.


## What impression commoditization means to publishers

The result of this
is that advertising dollars have moved from publications with well researched content written by knowledgeable authors
to low quality SEO optimized sites with re-purposed material developed to maximize paid ad impressions.
While there are a lot of reasons for the fall of newspapers, this dynamic is a major factor.
Instead of spending money on investigative reporters,
it makes more sense to churn out clickbait that rephrases research done somewhere else.

In essence, all impressions are the same from an ad tech-powered perspective.
Ad views have become a commodity.
For most ad-funded sites including many newspapers,
they now compete with every other web site in a race to attract the most views rather than focusing on quality.


## What publishers can do about it

Publishers can take back their audience and advertising revenue in two ways.
Cut off ad tech surveillance technology and stop providing ad space for these companies to show ads.
Ad tech is driven by personal data which, with some exceptions, is collected from individual publishers sites
through the use of third-party cookies, scripts, and other technologies.
Publishers should eliminate or severely restrict the use of these technologies
by the ad tech companies they allow on their pages.

This doesn't mean giving up your ad revenue, though.
While there seems to be unlimited ad space online there is a very limited amount of quality ad space.
Larger publishers can work directly with advertisers to privately place ads often driving up their own revenue
[as the New York Times did](https://open.nytimes.com/to-serve-better-ads-we-built-our-own-data-program-c5e039bf247b).
For publishers that are too small or unable to hire a sales force,
they can find an ad network that will place ads without sacrificing user privacy
or siphoning off their audience's data for the ad network's gain.

This is the reason we built the EthicalAds network.
There are lots of developer-focused sites that are too small to sell ads directly.
If you're looking for an ad network that won't compromise your audience,
[join EthicalAds]({filename}../pages/publishers.md) and help preserve privacy on the web!
