## New features from the previous month

* We released a new onboarding improvement to email advertisers
  when they launch their first campaign.
  The goal is to help them with onboarding new advertisers,
  pointing them toward the reporting they want,
  and generally help with navigating our platform.
* Publisher payouts using Stripe are now automated and they went well in October.
  This sped up payouts considerably.
* We did a [content piece]({filename}../posts/2024-best-performing-ads-by-conversion-type.md)
  on Ad Performance by Conversion Action
  which compared ad CTRs between ads that link to a product, a form,
  or to some sort of content piece like a webinar or ebook.
  The findings were what we expected to find based on experience
  but worth reading if you're an advertiser considering what your lead magnet is.
* We are continuing to improve our [ad rotation](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#automatic-ad-rotation)
  features we built for our ad client. We're continuing to iterate here,
  although we've scaled back rotations somewhat.
  We also building some reporting features around this.

You can always see our latest server updates in our
[ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html)
and [ethical-ad-client changelog](https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).


## October advertising stats

[comment]: https://server.ethicalads.io/publisher/all/report/?start_date=2024-10-01&end_date=2024-10-31

Last month:

* We generated **$41,677.24** for our publishers and they'll receive this payout next week.
* We had **181 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **26,279,987** paid ad views across the world.
  This is the highest it's ever been and our new run of network options
  are allowing us to sell a larger percentage of our traffic especially in regions
  that were historically undersold.
  We also have some very broad campaigns running.

We are seeing some softness in our core markets
after a few mid-sized advertisers put campaigns on hold
and a larger one pulled back.

We are running a November discount for new advertisers
where we're offering the discounts we [normally]({filename}../pages/advertisers-pricing.md)
give at $3k and $25k at lower thresholds ($1k and $5k).
If you're interested in running a campaign, [get in touch]({filename}../pages/advertisers.md#inbound-form)!


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap for November:

* We are building a bulk importer to handle uploading ads in bulk.
  A couple advertisers have asked for this to speed up the process
  when running multiple campaigns.
* We'll be releasing some new advertiser features to have read-only accounts
  that can just see report data but not make any changes to ads themselves.
* There may not be a lot of progress here in the next one month
  but we are beginning to experiment with some larger ad placements on publishers who want this.
  If you're an advertiser interested in a larger ad format,
  [let us know]({filename}../pages/advertisers.md#inbound-form).


Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
Please [let us know]({filename}../pages/contact.md) if you have any ideas or feedback on our product or roadmap,
we always love to hear from you.
