## New features from the previous month

* We released our new
  [prospectus]({static}../prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf)
  for Q1. It has a price reduction across a few markets and some more information on
  [niche targeting]({filename}../pages/niche-targeting.md).
* The legwork for a new advertiser domain breakdown report was finished up
  and we expect the report to be live in the next few days.
  This report will break down advertiser traffic
  by the domain where the ad was shown. Quite a few advertisers asked for this.
* We got a few more advertisers trying our [niche targeting]({filename}../pages/niche-targeting.md) options.
  This resulted in us building a few additional UX and reporting features for it.
* We began testing some ads on Reddit in a very small way.
  This had a couple goals from learning more about what our competitors are doing well
  so these features can be integrated into our own service
  as well as trying to get a few new advertisers while doing it.

You can always see our latest server updates in our
[ethical-ad-server changelog](https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html)

## December advertising stats

[comment]: https://server.ethicalads.io/publisher/all/report/?start_date=2024-12-01&end_date=2024-12-31

Last month:

* We generated **$32,527.31** for our publishers and they'll receive this in a payout next week.
  This number is lower than it has been in recent months.
* We had **176 publishers** on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
* We had **22,086,641** paid ad views across the world.

The holidays always come with lower traffic and revenue every year.
However, they also usually come with slightly higher performance for advertisers despite the much lower traffic.

We are continuing to see availability in our core markets.
If you've been waiting for a good time to advertise with us,
we have a price reduction
in our latest prospectus and [pricing page]({filename}../pages/advertisers-pricing.md).
If you're interested in running a campaign, [get in touch]({filename}../pages/advertisers.md#inbound-form)!


## Upcoming features

The major features in our upcoming roadmap for January:

* We are beginning to experiment with some larger ad placements on publishers who want this.
  If you're an advertiser interested in a larger ad format,
  [let us know]({filename}../pages/advertisers.md#inbound-form).
* We're aiming to have a new ad format for sites that want a fixed header ad.
* A few months back we streamlined how our publisher payouts worked on Stripe.
  This makes the process on our end better and ensures that we only collect what data we need
  (Stripe can collect tax information if necessary) and made payouts quicker for publishers using Stripe.
  After some initial exploration, PayPal will be trickier to do the same,
  but we're hoping to have some PayPal improvements over the next month or two.

Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
Please [let us know]({filename}../pages/contact.md) if you have any ideas or feedback on our product or roadmap,
we always love to hear from you.
