Read the Docs is probably not the first place you think of if you are
recruiting. However, over **7 million unique developers use Read the
Docs each month** from all over the world. We didn't set out to build a
better job board, but after a number of advertisers used our [ethical
ads](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advertising/ethical-advertising.html)
for recruiting, we discovered that Read the Docs was a great place to
find developer talent.

Hiring with Read the Docs works
-------------------------------

Developers are not always actively job seeking by browsing job boards or
company careers pages. However, they are on Read the Docs reading about
the libraries and frameworks they use. Even when people aren't actively
looking for a new job, many are open to exploring new opportunities.

On Read the Docs, we found that developers engage with hiring ads at a
higher rate than any other kind of advertising. With hiring ads,
developers get ads that are relevant and interesting and companies reach
the folks actively using the tech they are recruiting for.

Be specific and find the right developers
-----------------------------------------

If you are looking for Python developers, you can configure your hiring
ad to only show on Python related documentation. You can further refine
your audience to Read the Docs visitors in specific regions. Whether you
are looking for a remote Python data scientist or a blockchain developer
in Switzerland, be as specific as possible. This ensures you don't get
unqualified candidates as well as making sure you catch the eyes of the
people you are interested in.


Set the right expectations
--------------------------

In any type of advertising, setting appropriate expectations can make
the difference between a lackluster and successful campaign. In hiring,
it is even more critical. This means making sure that your hiring ad for
a front-end JavaScript developer links directly to your JavaScript
developer job listing page where people can click "apply". Don't link
to a listing of all of your open positions unless your hiring ad sets
that expectation. Nothing is worse for the developer than clicking on a
hiring ad and not knowing what to do next.

Likewise, some things can set the wrong kind of expectation. Most
developers have seen enough hiring posts for "rockstars" and
"ninjas" to know what to expect. Be honest and upfront and you will
attract the right folks.


Stand out
---------

Developers get contacted all the time by recruiters and it can be
difficult to show prospective employees why they should check out your
company. People look for all sorts of different things when seeking a
new job from working with a high-caliber team to working for a company
whose goals they agree with. You should highlight your best selling
points right on your hiring ad as early as possible. If your company
affords a fantastic work/life balance, mention that. A company in a
great location, with a beautiful office, and top of the line hardware
should definitely feature that. Focusing on your best attributes shows
you care about your developers and helps you appeal to people who care
about your products and mission.
