[TOC]

## How are ads priced?

Our [prices](/advertisers/#pricing) differ by topic and by geography and rates change quarterly to balance demand.

Ads are priced in cost per thousand impressions (CPM) and
we also offer an automatic 10% discount for ad buys of $3,000 or more.

While you might setup a recurring campaign to be billed monthly,
all our pricing is per impression.

Our
[prospectus]({static}/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf)
has all the details.


## Can I post an ad promoting my job openings?

Absolutely. [Hiring developers]({filename}advertisers-hiring.md)
is one of the most popular reasons for advertising with us.
We put your job right in front of developers using your technology.


## How can I target my ads?

In line with our [ethical advertising
approach]({filename}vision.md),
we believe that ads can be well targeted while respecting users'
privacy. We only target based on a user's country and the content
of the page where the ad is served.
For ads targeting the USA, we also support targeting by state.

Advertisers may also target ads by topics.
Currently, these topics are:

* Data science and machine learning
* Backend web development
* Frontend web development
* Security and privacy
* DevOps

Our
[prospectus]({static}/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf)
will have the latest details and rates on keyword targeting.
More niche targeting is possible although campaigns may take longer to fulfill due to availability.
[Inquire](/advertisers/#inbound-form) for details.


## How does topic targeting work?

We analyze the publishers and web pages where are ads are shown
in order to understand what those pages are about.
We use a contextual machine learning model trained on real pages where our ads appear
and it classifies content into our topics (or no topic).
This allows us to show the most relevant ads possible.

More relevant ads are better for advertisers because they perform better
and better for publishers because they usually earn more money from them.


## What geographic regions can I target?

[comment]: # (Linked from a footnote in the pricing page)

We can target any region you'd like where we have enough inventory to run a campaign.
Most of our advertisers are focused on North America and Europe
although we have some advertisers interested in other regions
such as Asia Pacific or India.
Our [prospectus]({static}/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf) has more pricing options
but please [let us know](/advertisers/#inbound-form) what you're interested in and we can quote you a price.

Some advertisers want to focus globally.
For those advertisers, we recommend splitting your budget between what you're interested in targeting.
For example, you can spend 67% of your budget on North America and Europe and 33% outside those regions.
This ensures advertisers get exactly what they expect.


## What are the ad specifications?

There are two main ad placements across the EthicalAds network.
Publishers choose which placement best fits with their site
and we have seen great performance for advertisers and publishers with both types.

* We support unobtrusive text &amp; image placements which use a 240 * 180px image
  (displayed at 120 * 90) and up to 100 characters of supporting text.
  An optional headline and call-to-action (part of the 100 characters) are bolded.
* There's also a text-only placement that uses up to 100 characters without an image.

[ad specs]({static}/prospectus/ad-specs.pdf)
with more details and screenshots.


## Where do the ads link to?

The ads can link to any URL. Typically they will link to your
landing page on your website. You may include UTM parameters or
other URL parameters to know that the traffic came from your ad on
our site.


## How do I track conversions?

Some other ad networks help advertisers to track conversions by using conversion pixels or beacons.
These pixels are an image that advertisers can put on a conversion page.
At EthicalAds, we don't use conversion pixels due to privacy concerns
(see our guide on [surveillance advertising]({filename}/pages/learning-hub/surveillance-advertising.md)).
Instead, to track conversions, use your existing conversion tracking mechanism such as analytics
and rely on UTM or other parameters added to your ad destination link.
Keep in mind that our audience is a little more privacy-focused than the general public
and JavaScript-based conversion metrics like Google Analytics can understate true conversions.


## How are my ads scheduled?

We attempt to schedule advertising evenly based on the length and
size of your campaign. However, if you want to advertise as fast as
possible, we can definitely do that.


## Can I run my ad JavaScript?

In order to respect our users' privacy, we do not allow any
third-party ad scripts.


## How can I see how my ads are performing?

Once you become an advertiser with us, you will have access to view
live reports on the performance of your ads including how many times
they were viewed and clicked. We count a viewable impression when
the ad comes into the browser viewport.

Check out a video overview of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAhhxhyJY28">reporting interface</a>.


## How can I manage my ads?

After you become an advertiser, you will get access to our advertising platform
where you can create, change, or turn off your ads as well as see live reports broken down by each ad.

## How can I optimize my ads?

For all but the smallest campaigns, we recommend running multiple ads in your campaign.
These A/B tests will usually show that some ads perform better than others.
After you've collected enough data, turn the lower performing variant off to maximize your performance.


## Will you help me optimize my campaign?

Absolutely. You can contact us anytime, but an ad specialist will proactively reach out
a few weeks into your campaign with suggestions.
We also offer advice on crafting ads that resonate with our audience.
See our [advertising guide]({filename}/pages/learning-hub/advertiser-guide.md) for more details.

For larger campaigns,
we provide a short video summary of how your campaign is performing
with detailed suggestions to try to boost performance.


## Where do my ads appear?

Ads appear on sites that belong to our publisher network. Placement
is customizable based on their requirements, but we always ensure
a valuable placement.


## What type of ads are acceptable?

We want ads that are of interest to our audience of millions of
software developers.

EthicalAds has final approval for all ads with respect to
editorial and creative content but generally this isn't an issue.


## What are the details of the EthicalAds audience?

See [our audience](/our-audience/).


## Do my ads support open source?

EthicalAds is open source software and the ads go to support
development of the publishers where ads are hosted.


## How can I get started advertising?

We thought you'd never ask. Simply fill out our [advertising
information form]({filename}advertisers.md#inbound-form).
A member of our team will contact you with a detailed prospectus and
will walk you through the process of getting started advertising on
EthicalAds.
