status: hidden

Effective date: **December 8, 2022**

Thank you for using EthicalAds ("Read the Docs, Inc.", "EthicalAds", "we")! We're happy you're here.
Please read this Terms of Service agreement carefully before accessing or using EthicalAds.
Because it is such an important contract between us and our users,
we have tried to make it as clear as possible.
For your convenience, we have presented these terms in a short non-binding summary
followed by the full legal terms.

If you are not a publisher or advertiser on our network,
these terms generally do not apply to you.
If you're just concerned about how we handle data from users
who view ads on our network, see our [privacy policy]({filename}../pages/privacy-policy.md).

## Definitions

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement,
and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we
use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's
still useful information.*


1.  The "Agreement" refers, collectively, to all the terms,
    conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the
    "Terms of Service" or the "Terms") and all other operating
    rules, policies (including our [privacy policy]({filename}../pages/privacy-policy.md))
    and procedures that we may publish from time to time on our site and network.
2.  Our "Service" or "Services" refers to the applications,
    software, products, and services provided by EthicalAds.
3.  The "Network" refers to EthicalAds' network
    located at ethicalads.io and server.ethicalads.io,
    and all content, services, and products provided by EthicalAds at
    or through our sites and Network.
4.  "The User," "You," and "Your" refer to the individual person,
    company, or organization that has a publisher or advertiser account using our Network
    or Services; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that
    directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions.
    A User must be at least 13 years of age.
5.  "EthicalAds," "We," and "Us" refer to Read the Docs, Inc.,
    as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors,
    licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6.  An "Account" represents your legal relationship with EthicalAds.
    A "User Account" represents an individual User's
    authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a
    User's identity on EthicalAds.
    Generally, users who merely see or click on ads do not have an Account.
7.  A "Publisher" is a person, company, or organization who hosts ads from our Network
    on their own website.
    An "Advertiser" is a person, company, or organization who advertises on our Network.
    Both Advertisers and Publishers have Accounts.
8.  "User Personal Information" is any information about one of our
    users which could, alone or together with other information,
    personally identify him or her. Information such as a user name and
    password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are
    examples of User Personal Information. Our
    [privacy policy]({filename}../pages/privacy-policy.md) goes into more
    details on User Personal Information, what data EthicalAds
    collects from Advertisers, Publishers, or visitors who merely see or click on an ad,
    and why we collect it.


### Our services

EthicalAds is made up of the following sites:

ethicalads.io

:   This website contains landing pages explaining our Service and Network.

server.ethicalads.io ("Ad Server")

:   The website that serves ads on behalf of our Advertisers
    and are displayed on Publishers' websites.


## Account terms

*User Accounts have different administrative controls;
a human must create your Account (usually after receiving an invite); you must be 13 or over;
and you must provide a valid email address.
You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account.
You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### Account controls

Users
    Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Content within it. Users can share access to their Publisher or Advertiser accounts with other Users.

### Required information

You must provide a valid email address in order to receive an invite and complete the signup process.
Any other information requested, such as your real name, is
optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal
entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity).
In order to pay for advertising or receive payouts as a publisher,
we may require additional information necessary for billing purposes.

### Account requirements

We have a few simple rules for User Accounts on EthicalAds'
Services.

-   You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by
    "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit
    machine accounts:
-   A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who
    accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email
    address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is
    used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may
    direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the
    Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions.
-   You must be age 13 or older. We must comply with United States law.
    EthicalAds does not target
    our Services to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users
    under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of
    13, we will have to close your account. If you are a resident of a
    country outside the United States, your country's minimum age may
    be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with
    your country's laws.
-   You may not use EthicalAds in violation of export control or
    sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable
    jurisdiction. You may not use EthicalAds if you are or are
    working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National
    (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx)
    or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions
    administered by a U.S. government agency. EthicalAds may allow
    persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access
    certain EthicalAds services pursuant to U.S. government
    authorizations.

### User Account security

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our
Service.

-   You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account.
-   You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and
    password. EthicalAds cannot and will not be liable for any loss
    or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
-   You will promptly
    [notify EthicalAds]({filename}../pages/contact.md) if
    you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our
    Services through your Account, including any unauthorized use of
    your password or Account.

### Additional terms

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of EthicalAds.
For example, you may be a member of an advertising team using EthicalAds
with its own terms or license agreements; or you may download
an application that integrates with EthicalAds. Please be aware that
while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms
govern their relationships with you.


## Acceptable use

**Short version:** *EthicalAds runs an ad network and our publishers and advertisers
are from all over the world. While using our network and
service, you must follow the terms of this section.*

Your use of our Network and Services must not violate any applicable
laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions
laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making
sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any
applicable regulations.


## API terms

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this
Section, when using any of EthicalAds' APIs (Application Provider Interface),
or our ad client which is used by publishers to display ads
including use of the API through a third party product that
accesses EthicalAds.*

### No abuse or overuse of the API

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to EthicalAds via the API may
result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's
access to the API. EthicalAds, in our sole discretion, will determine
abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt
to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed EthicalAds' rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from EthicalAds
for spamming or fraudulent purposes, including for the purposes
of ad fraud or generating fake traffic that looks like site visitors.

All use of the EthicalAds API is subject to these Terms of Service
and our [privacy policy]({filename}../pages/privacy-policy.md).


## Advertising on the EthicalAds network

**Short version:** *We run an ad network and our network provides guarantees
about how we fairly handle advertising and disputes as well as expectations
on our advertisers and publishers.*

### Our privacy-focused advertising

We run an advertising network which entails matching ad campaigns
from advertisers with relevant publisher sites.
We **do not** run any code from advertisers and all ad images are hosted on
EthicalAds' servers.

In general, we only collect the minimum amount of personal information that is necessary to run an ad network;
we don't sell information to third parties (we sell ads); and we only use it as our
[Privacy Policy]({filename}../pages/privacy-policy.md) describes.

### As a publisher

We have a dedicated [publisher policy]({filename}../pages/publisher-policy.md)
with more details on our expectations for publishers including how ads are displayed
and how payouts are made.

### As an advertiser

Unless superseded by these terms, ad campaigns on EthicalAds apply the
AAAA/IAB Standard Terms and Conditions for Internet Advertising for Media Buys One Year or Less V.3.0
With Oregon as the governing law and venue.
These terms are available at [IAB.net](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/standard-terms-conditions-internet-advertising-media-buys-one-year-less/).
Our ad server at server.ethicalads.io will be used for serving and tracking as that agreement outlines.

Your ad campaign may run in a longer amount of time, based on availability and traffic.
We can usually provide a good estimate of your campaign duration before the campaign starts.

We request payment for an advertiser's first campaign before the campaign starts.
EthicalAds will send invoices to Customer electronically to the email address provided.
Customer will remit all payments within thirty (30) days from receipt of invoices,
which will be deemed to be the date sent by EthicalAds.
Customer will notify EthicalAds of any change in contact information for billing purposes
by sending such notice by email to ads@ethicalads.io.


## Payment

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with
your use of EthicalAds. We are responsible for communicating those
fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance
if those prices change.*

### Pricing

Our pricing is available in our [prospectus]({static}/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf)
and usually changes quarterly. If you start a campaign with us,
the campaign price whether per impression (CPM) or per click (CPC),
will remain your price for the duration of the campaign and payment term;
however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### Billing schedule; no refunds

-   For advertising campaigns, the Service is billed on net-30 terms
    usually on a monthly or quarterly basis and is non-refundable.
    A customer may stop or pause a campaign and apply the credit to a future campaign.
-   Exceptions to these rules are at EthicalAds' sole discretion.

### Authorization

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to
invoice you for services you authorize for EthicalAds.

### Responsibility for payment

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your
use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay EthicalAds
any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you
dispute the matter, [contact us]({filename}../pages/contact.md).
You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for advertiser Accounts.
Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

### Publisher payouts

We handle payouts once a month,
with a minimum payment of **$50**.
Our goal is to get payment to our publishers by the 15th of the month,
with the payment being the balance at the end of the prior month.

For our compliance and for tax purposes, we may require a government ID from you
in certain circumstances to process payouts.
We will ask for this explicitly if and when we require it.
We handle your information securely and it is deleted
no later than 30 days after your next payout.

For more details, see our
[publisher policy]({filename}../pages/publisher-policy.md).


## Cancellation and termination

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do,
we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### Publisher account cancellation

Generally, a publisher on our Network may stop serving ads for our network
at any time. You don't need any permission to do so but you will stop
earning ad revenue. We are interested in why you stopped as that is a way
for us to improve our product and services and we would like to hear from you.

### Advertiser account cancellation

Most advertisers are billed on a per-campaign basis and most campaigns
do not automatically renew. If an advertiser does not authorize a campaign
to continue, they will not be billed further.

### Account deletion

We generally do not delete accounts of past advertisers or publishers.
You may request that your account be deleted by emailing ads@ethicalads.io.

### Upon deletion

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our
legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but
barring legal requirements, we will delete your full account within 90 days
of deletion. This information can not be recovered once your Account is
deleted.

### EthicalAds may terminate

EthicalAds has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all
or any part of our Network at any time, with or without cause, with or
without notice, effective immediately. EthicalAds reserves the right
to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### Survival

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive
termination *will* survive termination --including, without limitation:
ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations
of liability.


## Communications with EthicalAds

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in
touch with our users.*

    the email address you have submitted or via the Service.
2.  Agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures,
    and other communications that we provide to you electronically

    satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your
    non-waivable rights.

### Legal notice to EthicalAds must be in writing

Communications made through email or EthicalAds' support system will
not constitute legal notice to EthicalAds or any of its officers,
employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to
EthicalAds is required by contract or any law or regulation.
Legal notice to EthicalAds must be in writing.

promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section
carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

EthicalAds provides the Service and the Network "as is" and "as
available," without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we
expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or

## Limitation of liability

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising
from your use or inability to use the Service or otherwise arising under
this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our
obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third
party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any
incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages,
however arising, that result from:

-   the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;

possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this
Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have
no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our
reasonable control.


## Release and indemnification

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If
you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will
not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release EthicalAds
from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and
consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out
of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and
against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including
attorneys' fees, arising out of your use of the Network and the
Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement,
provided that EthicalAds:

1.  Promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or
    proceeding
2.  Gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim,
    demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any
    claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement
    unconditionally releases EthicalAds of all liability)
3.  Provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.


## Changes to these terms

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important
changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important --- we
don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may
modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any changes
that affect your rights and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of
Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event
of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to
this Agreement, such as price changes, prior to any new ad campaigns
by posting a notice on our Website. For
non-material modifications, your continued use of the Service
constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or
discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it)
with or without notice.
