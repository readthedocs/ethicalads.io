## About the job

Currently, every single advertiser talks to either Eric Holscher or David Fischer.
You will be selling privacy-focused developer advertising to technical marketers.
You will work directly with the two of us and be able to have a big impact!

To start with, this role would be part-time at about 20 hours per week.
You will be helping with advertiser sales, reaching out to past advertisers about new campaigns,
and help onboard new advertisers so their campaigns are a success.

Our sales process is a bit different than some other places.
Here are some important parts:

- We believe that cold calling and cold outreach is a waste of time for our current business.
  All our business has come from introductions, inbound leads from our website,
  referrals, or other warm lead sources.
- A significant majority of our business is from regular advertisers
  who advertise every month or quarter.
  The remainder is new or sporadic advertisers testing a new marketing channel
  or running a time-sensitive campaign for a specific event or release.
  Your role will be to help get more of the latter type of advertiser
  and help them become regular advertisers.
- EthicalAds does not have long-term contracts lasting more than about a quarter.
  This means that a lot of our business needs to be won every quarter on the merits
  of the previous campaign. Selling hard and then under-delivering does not grow the business.
  Winning repeat business is how our business actually grows.

Interest and skills in any of the following is a big plus so please let us know in your application:

- Advertising & digital marketing
- Open source software
- Online privacy


## Details and responsibilities

You will be responsible for handling the part of the sales pipeline that aims to win new customers.
Here's what that pipeline looks like:

- You will be the first level of sales support on inbound leads.
  Most of these leads come from [this form on our website]({filename}../advertisers.md#inbound-form).
  We have a shared email inbox for handling this and while there are some common questions advertisers ask
  (see our [FAQ]({filename}../advertising-faq.md)),
  many advertisers also ask lots of unique questions.
- You will need to assess whether the advertiser is a good fit for our network
  (budgets make sense, their product pricing will work for display ads, developer-focused, etc.).
  Remember that our goal is repeat business. There's no reason to sell a campaign
  that will not be a good fit.
- If the advertiser seems like a fit and the campaign seems like the kind of campaign
  that will work on our network, the next step is to do a sales call and demo.
  Here you will show our product, discuss our features and advantages,
  and help familiarize the advertiser with how we help their campaign succeed.
- Once a new advertiser is ready, you will issue them an invoice,
  start their campaign, and schedule followups to check-in on their campaign progress
  and win them as a repeat customer.

This pipeline can take as little as a day or sometimes months.
Most advertisers take about 3-4 weeks to close.


### Prospecting past advertisers

The other area of focus is on starting new campaigns with past clients.
There are lots of reasons why an advertiser stopped advertising
from a budget reduction, staff turnover, or maybe their company didn't need to advertise regularly.
Regardless, we've found that past clients are an excellent source of new business.

This sales funnel looks more like traditional sales prospecting
except that you will be prospecting from our existing CRM or past email contacts.

- You will review clients that are not currently advertising,
  but have either run a past campaign or were lost somewhere in the sales funnel.
- Contact these clients and assess their interest in a new campaign.
  Sometimes, our contacts at companies have turned over and it may be necessary
  to find a new contact with a similar title at that company.
- For prospects open to a new campaign, they may require a sales call and demo
  similar to new clients especially if this person isn't familiar with our product and platform.

This pipeline is usually a bit faster than for new sales.
