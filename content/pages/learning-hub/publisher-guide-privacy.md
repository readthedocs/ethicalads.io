description: A guide to help website owners ensure their site respects the privacy of their visitors


## Privacy can mean lots of things

* https://www.eff.org/issues/privacy
* Closely related with security https://www.eff.org/issues/security


## Overview of tracking technology

Overall, I think this section could use very detailed examples of exactly how cookies track people for example.

* Fingerprinting, Supercookies, etc.
* Analytics
* Personalized ads


## Privacy regulation and standards

* cookie banners
* GDPR/CCPA and what they require
* Do Not Track
* Privacy policies


## Non-tracking alternatives

* Plausible, Fathom, or SimpleAnalytics instead of Google Analytics
* Use non-tracking advertising like EthicalAds (said without irony)


## Tools to help your build a privacy-focused site

* Blacklight: https://themarkup.org/blacklight
* Run your site with an adblocker like AdblockPlus, UblockOrigin, Disconnect, or Privacy Badger

## Basic site security

* SSL/TLS and why it's important: https://www.eff.org/encrypt-the-web
* Don't store data you don't need and don't store data longer than you have to
* Strong passwords
* Maybe briefly discuss what VPNs and Tor do or do not accomplish
