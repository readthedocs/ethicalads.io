## Creating great developer ads

There are many factors to successful display advertising.
Compelling branding and optimized landing pages are important,
but it all starts with the image and text copy.

> For copy to convince the consumer to buy the product, it must do four things:
>
> - Get attention
> - Communicate
> - Persuade
> - Ask for a response
>
> â€” Robert W. Bly, "The Copywriter's Handbook"

The average click-through rate (CTR) for display ads across our network is around 0.12%.
The best ads perform more than **three times better** than that.

Here are some features of high quality ads:

### Informative copy

Great ads often include not only the benefits of the product,
but also have industry specific phrasing that grabs the attention of the intended audience.
For a DevOps related ad, mentioning Kubernetes or Docker will grab attention.

Great ads often feature:

* A brief explanation of the product.
* A free trial/demo.
* A competitive discount.

This informs the viewer of what to expect to see on the linked landing page after clicking the ad.

### Honed targeting

Developers come in all shapes, sizes, and [specialties](https://www.ethicalads.io/our-audience/),
only some are a perfect fit for your product or service.
To get the most out of your campaign:

* Make sure your geographic targeting matches the location of your desired customers.
* Target a specific topic that's relevant to your business.
* Craft a specific ad for each region of interest.

These tips will help increase the click-through rate of your ads,
and the likelihood of those users resulting in conversions.

### Multiple ad variations

When you run a campaign we recommend having 3-4 ad variations,
especially for larger campaigns.
This allows you to test the performance of different marketing messages and ad images.
Then you can **create iterations of your top-performing ads, and disable your lowest performing ads** for better click-through rates.
[2 weeks into your campaign](#collaborate-with-us-to-get-great-results) we'll reach out with a note on how to adjust your ads to improve performance.

### Fresh images and copy

The performance of ads fades slowly over time.
This is known as "ad fatigue" and is due to each user seeing the same ad over and over
without providing any new images, information, or offers.
**Swapping ads once every quarter will keep your ads from getting stale.**

### Recommended ad images

In terms of high-performing ad images we have a few recommendations:

* **Conversion-focused campaigns**: Use simplified product screenshots, workflow diagrams, or other ad images that showcase the product.
* **Brand advertising**: Include your logo somewhere in the ad image and product name in the ad copy. This can also include screenshots or workflows, or a large brand image.
* **All campaigns**: Take inspiration from your landing pages for the ad images. This keeps things consistent and is an easy way to [pair ad copy with the landing page](#pair-ad-copy-with-the-landing-page).

Our [SaaS product example](#saas-product) example shows a good combination of this approach,
but it's worth trying more focused variations as well.

## Optimizing conversions

Having developers click on your ad is only half the battle.
Once users arrive at your landing page,
you want the visitor to take action!

Here are some key points to help your ads convert visitors to customers:

### Pair ad copy with the landing page

Nothing is worse than clicking on an ad and being confused
about what is being offered or what the next steps are.
**The language from your ad motivated the user to click,
so use similar wording and images on your landing page.**

### Set expectations with the ad

In addition to just pairing with the copy, the ad can prepare the visitor
for what will be on the landing page.
A classic example of this is an ad that features a large discount (eg. "get $100 free credit").
This large discount has set the expectation that the product will be fairly expensive,
but the credit will give the customer a way to try it out.

## Examples of some top developer ads

Here are some things that have worked well for our advertisers in the past:

### SaaS product

![A successful SaaS product ad on the EthicalAds network](../images/pages/learning-hub/successful-ad-2.png){style="width: 100%"}

This example is based on a successful ad used to drive interest to a SaaS product.
The ad catches the reader's eye without being flashy,
it is technology specific, and the ad
**makes it clear what problem is being solved**.
Additionally, the ad offers a free trial which helps to overcome any
objections that somebody who needs sales reports from their Django app
might have.

### Hiring developers

![A successful ad aimed at hiring developers on the EthicalAds network](../images/pages/learning-hub/successful-ad-1.png){style="width: 100%"}

A similar ad was used by an advertiser to hire multiple developers for their team.
The ad did a number of things right including
focusing extremely narrowly on their target audience.
When the ad first launched,
the **click-through rate was 4x better than our average because it was so specific.**

One possible area for improvement would be to introduce the company's
branding to reassure applicants that this is first party recruiting.
