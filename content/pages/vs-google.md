description: A few reasons that you should consider EthicalAds as a simple, open-source, privacy-first alternative to Google Ads

We often get asked why you should choose EthicalAds instead of an existing display network like Google AdSense.
Many people default to Google when they think about online advertising,
and we think we're a great alternative for developer-focused sites.

## Privacy of your users (and compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA)

When your user goes to your website, they are assuming they will only be sending data to you. Some users consider it a breach of trust if you were to share that data with other third parties, and it might be a breach of a privacy law to do this without user consent. Google is well-known for it's data collection policies, and they are used to target ads on your website and many other sites around the internet.

When you use EthicalAds, **we never set cookies on your users**, and we don't use any user-specific data to target advertising. This means [you don't need a cookie banner](../content/posts/2021-can-you-remove-cookie-banners.md) when you use our ads, and your users data is not being tracked across the internet.

## Transparency on what ads get shown

Google shows ads based on the user who is viewing your site, which means they could be seeing ads totally unrelated to your site content. Sometimes this results in ads that you might find objectionable, might freak your users out by following them around the web, or many other issues.

**EthicalAds only shows ads based on the content of your site.** They are guaranteed to be developer-focused, and won't follow users around the web. We're so confident in our advertisers, **we give you a dashboard that shows every advertiser on your site** so you know exactly what your users are seeing.

## Simple and open source approach

The code behind Google ads is proprietary and incredibly complex. This is because there is a large amount of time being spent trying to figure out exactly who you are and how to target you with an ad.

With EthicalAds, our code is both simple and open source. You can look at our [ethical ad server](https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server/) and [ethical ad client](https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-client/) on GitHub. You can even read the exact logic we use to select that ads that show on your website, because we don't need complex tracking logic.

## Diversify the web ecosystem by supporting more advertising options

Google and Facebook account for the vast majority of advertising revenue on the internet. Having all the revenue concentrated in these two companies makes it harder for independent publishers and companies to get started. We think our approach to advertising is worth investing in, and we hope to make it a larger percentage of the way the internet does advertising.

We talk more about the issues with [invasive ad tracking](../content/posts/2021-invasive-ad-targeting-bad-journalism-premium-publishers.md), and how it hurts journalism and anyone creating high-value content on the web. We are hoping to break this vicious cycle by offering a better way to support developer-focused publishers on the internet.
