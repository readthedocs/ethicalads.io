&lt;p&gt;Our progress in June was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our progress in June was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We released an update to our ad client that will improve
  single page app (SPA) support. Many publishers use single page apps
  which rewrite the content of the page but don't actually reload it.
  For long lasting pages that transition based on user interaction,
  it may make sense to rotate the ad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We wrote a part two blog post of the ad industry that details
  &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2023/06/how-the-internet-ads-industry-works-modern-invasive-ad-targeting/"&gt;modern invasive ad targeting&lt;/a&gt;
  and how it's still possible to get great ad performance without it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added the ability for advertisers to request a new campaign.
  This is a first step toward making our ad platform more self-serve,
  something we've wanted for a long time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest server updates in our

&lt;h2 id="june-advertising-stats"&gt;June advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2023:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$40,336.00&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers. This is up marginally from May.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;169 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;24,375,898&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June outperformed for us in terms of expectations made in late May.
Overall, we continue to be almost completely booked up in the US and Canada
and have a little bit of spare capacity in Europe.
As a result, we lowered our European ad prices slightly for Q3 outside of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, we expect similar performance in July to June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap for July:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We built some frequency capping features that will allow
  setting maximum percentages of a campaign that will fill
  on certain publishers or in certain countries or regions.
  This should give better performance to our advertisers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are going to release our ad client as a UMD JavaScript module
  which should allow it to be installed by NPM and similar tools.
  This is a quality of life improvement a few publishers have asked for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For advertiser campaigns that absolutely need to stop on a certain date
  because they promote a certain event or time-sensitive release,
  we are implementing a "hard stop" date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ads we encounter online seem to be …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a follow-up post to our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2023/05/how-the-internet-ads-industry-works-players-tactics-pii-part-i/"&gt;overview of the ads industry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ads we encounter online seem to be increasingly tailored to our personal interests and preferences.
This is no accident but rather the result of modern ad targeting
and the massive personal data collection effort behind it.
Advertisers and adtech companies use sophisticated and sometimes invasive methods to track online behavior,
allowing them to deliver personalized ads to individual users
with what we call &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/surveillance-advertising/"&gt;surveillance advertising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of these approaches have proven effective for advertisers,
they have sparked privacy concerns and ethical debates about the use and collection of personal information.
In this post, we will delve into how ad targeting works, its privacy implications,
the evolving landscape of regulation, and what you as a user can do to protect yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="understanding-ad-targeting-the-basics"&gt;Understanding ad targeting: the basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the Internet, to reach a particular group of people,
marketers would buy a newspaper or TV spot that their target demographic reads or watches.
This technique of showing ads based on the surrounding content is called contextual targeting and is still relevant today.
The Internet, however, led to rapid evolution in ad targeting technologies
which enabled ads to be targeted more precisely than ever before.
At the core of this invasive targeting lies an intricate web of data collection on an unprecedented scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data collection techniques usually involve the use of cookies, pixels, or beacons,
but other approaches like fingerprinting or more rudimentary IP-based targeting can be used
when cookies can't be.
Advertisers running Facebook ads, for example, will deploy a pixel on their own site.
After users browse their site, Facebook will see the unique pixel and know that a specific user has visited
an exact site or even an exact page on a site.
The advertiser can then target that user with personalized ads meant only for users who have visited their site in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technique underpins a lot of Internet advertising and is called "retargeting" or "remarketing".
The same technique can be used to show ads to users who watch a specific video, launch a specific mobile app, search for specific terms, or even with a bit of work (Facebook and Google don't make this easy, other adtech companies aren't as picky) to target users who visit specific places in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage text-center"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-50 shadow-lg" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2023-ad-targeting-fbads-retargeting.png" alt="Retargeting options in Facebook Ads"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Facebook Ads retargeting allows showing ads to visitors of specific web pages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="privacy-concerns-crossing-the-line-or-good-business"&gt;Privacy concerns: crossing the line or good business?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about invasive ad targeting, privacy concerns inevitably take center stage.
Modern ad targeting techniques mean that huge amounts of personal data
-- browsing and search histories, what people do on their phones, and more --
are being collected and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, while users have a vague sense that what they type into Google Search or browse on Facebook
might be used for ad targeting, users may not understand that their browsing history is collected on other third-party sites as well.
The resulting data collection means that the big ad players have lengthy browsing histories of specific sites visited, videos watched, and apps launched on hundreds of millions if not billions of users.
As if all that data wasn't enough,
the big ad players will ask advertisers to upload even more personal data to better target users with ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage text-center"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-75 shadow-lg" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2023-ad-targeting-googleads-uploadpii.png" alt="Similar audiences/Lookalike audiences on Google Ads"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Google prompts marketers to upload other people's personal info to target ads&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2023/05/how-the-internet-ads-industry-works-players-tactics-pii-part-i/"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;,
we discussed ad exchanges, which facilitate the buying and selling of ad inventory in real-time.
They present some especially acute privacy concerns.
By design, exchanges involve publishers sending up user personal data
(usually obfuscated) for advertisers to bid on.
Unlike the example of browsing Facebook or Google,
it spreads copies of users' personal data to multiple companies,
many of which don't have a direct relationship with the person being shown the ad.
As a result, it means that a data breach at any of the companies in the chain can expose personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adtech companies will argue that well-targeted ads enhance the user experience.
Certainly it is better to show relevant products and services that align with a website visitors interests
instead of something completely unrelated.
However, the constant tracking and profiling of individuals can create a sense of unease,
and leading to a sense that ads "follow people" around the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="does-all-this-data-result-in-better-ads"&gt;Does all this data result in better ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would think that all this data would result in ad targeting better than you could possibly imagine.
While some companies would lead you to believe that it's impossible to do advertising without tracking,
that simply isn't true.
Almost every single worldwide brand you can name was built with more traditional advertising
before Internet surveillance advertising.
In spite of all the tracking, users still consistently complain about seeing irrelevant ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="protect-yourself-from-adtech"&gt;Protect yourself from adtech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address some of the concerns about data collection for ad targeting,
government regulations (and some industry initiatives) have emerged to set standards for data privacy and user consent.
Regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union
and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) among other state regulations in the US
aim to provide more transparency and rules about how and when data is collected,
what it can be used for, and how long it can be retained.
While these are important, hoping the government keeps up with big, well-funded adtech companies
or hoping that they self-regulate aren't the only way to keep yourself safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it might be strange for an ad company like us to recommend this,
tracker blockers or ad blockers are a great (but not foolproof) way to
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2023/02/keeping-yourself-safe-from-security-and-privacy-issues-in-advertising/"&gt;protect yourself from security and privacy issues on big ad networks&lt;/a&gt;.
Earlier this year for data privacy week,
we &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2023/01/data-privacy-week-2023-privacy-first-alternatives/#ad-blockers"&gt;recommended some ad blockers&lt;/a&gt;
as well as web browsers and search engines that help you keep your browsing history to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="responsible-ad-targeting-that-works"&gt;Responsible ad targeting that works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We opted-out of all the tracking and invasive targeting and
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/"&gt;our vision&lt;/a&gt; for advertising is quite different.
Instead of trying to build an ad network for everything, we focus exclusively on developers
so we don't need to track users to show the right ad to the right user.
Instead of letting any site onto our network with little or no oversight,
we talk to and vet every single publisher on our network.
Instead of letting any advertiser run anything in exchange for high ad bids,
we make sure the products advertisers are promoting are real products relevant to our audience.
No bogus sites, no scammy ads, and relevant products next to relevant content. That's it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this focus on quality means we'll never grow to be as big as Google,
it has let us build a sustainable ad business that supports hundreds
of developers with tens of thousands of dollars in ad revenue every month.
Thanks again for coming along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network
and to learn about how Internet ad targeting works on and off our network.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="adtech"></category><category term="business"></category></entry><entry><title>EthicalAds Newsletter - May 2023</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2023/06/ethicalads-newsletter-may-2023/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-06T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-06-06T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>David Fischer</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2023-06-06:/blog/2023/06/ethicalads-newsletter-may-2023/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our progress in May was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We released an updated &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;Q3 prospectus&lt;/a&gt;.
  The major changes were slightly increased US &amp;amp; Canada prices and slightly decreased European pricing.
  This is in response to our supply and demand where we've been completely booked in North America
  for essentially all of Q2. We are also highlighting a slightly higher discount for campaigns
  exceeding $25k per quarter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We wrote a blog post that features the
  &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2023/05/how-the-internet-ads-industry-works-players-tactics-pii-part-i/"&gt;lay of the land of the ad industry&lt;/a&gt;.
  We should have the second installment this month detailing how and why these players
  pass around personal identifiable info.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made some first steps toward phasing out some of our earlier approaches toward topic detection
  such as client side keyword and topic detection.
  We've been very happy with the performance and accuracy of our machine learning topic detection.
  This process will continue over the coming months.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2023:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$39,935.33&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers. This is down slightly from April.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;163 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
  This is unchanged from April.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;22,129,392&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are expecting a small slow down in June especially in Europe,
but overall we've seen steady although noisy growth in terms of advertisers
and campaign sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap for June:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't do frequency capping (limit showing the same ad to the same user)
  to quite the extent that many ad networks do due to privacy concerns.
  Instead, we focus on frequency capping across time and across a campaign.
  We're working on some additional features in this area which we believe
  will improve campaign performance and improve ad variety for publishers and site visitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have an update coming on our ad client that will improve
  single page app (SPA) support. Many publishers use single page apps
  which rewrite the content of the page but don't actually reload it.
  For long lasting pages that transition based on user interaction,
  it may make sense to rotate the ad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are rolling out a number of quality of life improvements
  for ourselves around speeding up the publisher payout process
  and configuring campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We built a new report for advertisers
  that shows a performance breakdown by topic and intended to release it in May.
  It should be released in the next week.&lt;/li&gt;

However …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the most basic level, advertising is a two-sided marketplace with publishers supplying ad impressions and advertisers buying them.
However, as Internet advertising has become more complicated, the landscape has grown
and there's some other parts of the AdTech ecosystem worth highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check out &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2023/06/how-the-internet-ads-industry-works-modern-invasive-ad-targeting/"&gt;part two covering modern ad targeting and troves of personal data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="supply-side"&gt;Supply side&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ad-networks"&gt;Ad networks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ad network like EthicalAds connects advertisers who want to advertise with publishers
that want to show those ads.
The largest such ad network is &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/alternative-to-google-ads/"&gt;Google AdSense&lt;/a&gt; that covers every possible topic and geography.
Facebook has their own much smaller one called Facebook Audience Network,
but there are many smaller networks that focus on niches like ours (developers who care about privacy).
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/alternative-to-carbon-ads/"&gt;CarbonAds&lt;/a&gt; is probably the closest ad network to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="publishers"&gt;Publishers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers are websties, apps, podcasts, or newsletters that show ads.
These range in size from small sites with very little traffic,
up to some of the biggest ad-funded websites on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many very large publishers sell their ad inventory directly or even have their own ad server.
This makes most sense for perhaps the top 100 largest websites and apps on the Internet
such as Facebook, Amazon, Snapchat, StackOverflow or Reddit. These publishers are large enough to have their own ad formats, servers, and sales teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because some of these large publishers have multiple sites
(eg. Amazon sells Twitch ads as well as sponsored products on Amazon itself, Facebook sells Instagram ads),
many very large publishers start to look like ad networks except they are the parent company for their publishers.
Their ads may still be sold by programmatic bidding in a similar way to an exchange or network,
except it is sold directly (called "Programmatic Direct Advertising").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="demand-side"&gt;Demand side&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="advertisers"&gt;Advertisers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisers are companies trying to reach consumers to inform them about their products and services
with the ultimate goal of driving more usage and sales.
Advertisers go where their customers or potential customers are
and that usually involves multiple networks and publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisers have different goals but ultimately they are always concerned with
how much exposure and how many new customers they are getting for their brand and products
compared to how much they are spending while also keeping their brand safe.
They might buy campaigns priced in a variety of different ways from per impression, per click, per lead/acquisition, or even a duration-based ad buy like an offline billboard or a monthly sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ad-agencies"&gt;Ad agencies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many advertisers use an ad agency to buy and place their ads for them on the right networks and publishers.
At EthicalAds, we deal with a number of ad agencies directly and have had good relationships with them.
Frequently, these agencies specialize in a particular segment of the market like developer advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While agencies usually have access to data like a company's analytics system,
they may not have access to all the same data as the advertiser themselves such as direct conversions
or conversions that happen after talking to a sales rep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ad-exchanges"&gt;Ad exchanges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad exchanges look very similar to ad networks but they are a marketplace that connects multiple advertisers,
the demand side, with multiple ad networks or large publishers, the supply side.
The key difference between a network and an exchange is that the exchange is merely facilitating the sale
like a stock exchange while a network is responsible for their own publishers.
Google operates one of the largest ad exchanges called AdX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad exchanges create markets for buying and selling of ad space.
In order for ad exchanges to run true auctions and have both bidding prices and asking prices,
they have to treat a lot of traffic as fungible commodities of user metadata such as location information or past actions.
Is an ad placement on the New York Times is the same as an ad on a personal blog if it reaches the right demographic (&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/05/how-invasive-ad-targeting-is-bad-for-journalism-and-other-high-quality-publishers/"&gt;we don't think so&lt;/a&gt;)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales through ad exchanges are frequently handled by "real-time bidding" (RTB) and programmatic advertising,
systems where advertisers place bids against user metadata
(geographic, demographics, past actions, and other behavioral attributes)
and these bids are matched against publisher traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These approaches usually involve building up databases of personal information on users
in order to better target them with ads.
Like many people in the ad ecosystem, these vast troves of data on millions of users scare us.
They will be covered in more detail in &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2023/06/how-the-internet-ads-industry-works-modern-invasive-ad-targeting/"&gt;part two of this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="adtech"></category><category term="business"></category></entry><entry><title>EthicalAds Newsletter - April 2023</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2023/05/ethicalads-newsletter-april-2023/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-05-11T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-05-11T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>David Fischer</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2023-05-11:/blog/2023/05/ethicalads-newsletter-april-2023/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our progress in April was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ads now have a live preview while advertisers edit them.
  We've always shown a preview of exactly what the ad looks like, but now it changes in real-time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're slowly rolling out more discussion of our machine learning topic classifier
  into our landing pages. Readers of our blog and our advertisers know about it,
  but we want to highlight it and be transparent about exactly how we classify content
  for great contextual ad targeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of our sales process improvements rolled out over the last month.
  Along with a new team member, Emily, we've been able to followup
  with a lot more past advertisers, past leads, and improve the quality of our sales process.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="april-advertising-stats"&gt;April advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2023:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$44,423.82&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers. While not a record, this is a very good month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;160 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
  This number has been creeping up nicely. We want it to grow slowly and steadily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;28,954,706&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.
  This beat last month's record.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've had some success selling a few more very broadly targeted campaigns that are increasing
our overall paid view numbers although sometimes those don't earn as much money as some other campaigns.
Regardless, we are very happy with these numbers. We are expecting May to be similar to April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap for May:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a new report coming for advertisers
  that shows a performance breakdown by topic.
  This will be especially interesting for advertisers focused on multiple topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We intend to rollout some additional publisher-focused changes
  that will help publishers using EthicalAds on multiple sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've been very happy with the performance of our topic classifier.
  It's proven to be more accurate than some of our previous naive attempts
  such as detecting keywords with our ad client.
  As a result we're going to be phasing out some of our other attempts
  and relying on our machine learning a bit more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're still refining it, but we will also have a content piece
  with the lay of the land of the ad industry. Lots of our publishers and many developers
  don't fully understand the ad industry and exploring what it looks like
  and the direction we hope to steer it toward are important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We rolled out a
  &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/ad-design-and-specs/"&gt;new landing page detailing our ad specs&lt;/a&gt;
  with a number of examples and tips to help campaigns perform their best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made some improvements to the landing pages that compare us against
  &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/alternative-to-carbon-ads/"&gt;Carbon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/alternative-to-google-ads/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made a number of improvements to our open source ad server
  which aim to help the folks who use it for their own purposes.
  We'd received some helpful feedback and wanted to show the community some love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The improvements we made in &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2023/03/ethicalads-newsletter-february-2023/#new-features"&gt;February&lt;/a&gt;
  to pacing and prioritization were rolled out to (almost) everybody.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are making a lot of improvements to our sales process.
  Beginning in early April, Eric and I are onboarding a sales rep to help for the next few months.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="march-advertising-stats"&gt;March advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2023:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$48,749.84&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers. This was our &lt;strong&gt;best month ever&lt;/strong&gt; for publisher revenue!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;152 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
  This number has been creeping up nicely. We want it to grow slowly and steadily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;23,744,797&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.
  This was another record for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March was a record month for us.
One change we made to our pricing recently was to lower the cost of some campaigns
in regions that have been historically undersold.
Partially as a result, we sold &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of traffic in those regions resulting in a huge increase
in total paid ads. While many of these don't earn a lot of money
(region is the biggest factor in &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/#pricing"&gt;our prices&lt;/a&gt;),
this was very nice to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't expect April to be quite as good as March, but it should still be a very good month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap for March:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have more advertiser UX improvements coming including
  a live preview so our advertisers can see exactly what their ads will look like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are still putting the finishing touches on some ML improvements
  to our content targeting.
  We continue to work with the team behind &lt;a href="https://spacy.io/"&gt;SpaCy&lt;/a&gt;
  to get those most out of our model (using their tool).
  It's great to keep contracting money in the OSS ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A number of improvements we're working on are for our sales process.
  The goal of these are to smooth the process for new and returning advertisers.
  In the past, we've joked that we could sell triple the amount of ads with no
  changes to our product. While that's a bit of an exaggeration,
  advertising requires doing sales and we are ramping up there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our progress in February was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We released a number of performance improvements to our reporting.
  All timeout issues have been resolved and performance is downright snappy on most reports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We released some improvements to our ad pacing that will yield
  better performance for our advertisers. Specifically we now allow pacing by the hour instead of by the day to spread out ads across the day more effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We released a change that will prioritize ads
  with high CTRs. This is another quality of life change for advertisers
  in order to improve their performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertiser-guide/#measuring-conversions"&gt;documented a few tips on measuring conversions&lt;/a&gt;.
  Advertisers are always comparing how much they spend on ads and what they got in return.
  We want our ad network to be measured consistently
  against other channels so advertisers can see for themselves that our network works well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We built a number of internal sales dashboards to better measure our inventory,
  what's starting soon and what is outstanding. The hope here is to be able to bring
  in some additional hands for our small sales team.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="february-advertising-stats"&gt;February advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2023:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$34,464.67&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;147 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;12,773,611&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned last month, we expected February to be a bit stronger than January
and we generated about $2,500 in additional revenue for our publishers despite the shorter month.
We expect March to be even stronger still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap for March:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We aim to update our advertiser guide with more examples of successful ads
  and concrete ways to track and measure the success of your ad campaigns
  (without compromising privacy).
  This didn't happen in February because it involved getting permission from advertisers
  which was a bit of a slow process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There has been some interest from the open source community in our server.
  We are spending some time to make it easier to take our ad server
  and use it to serve ads for your own project or website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently, we are combining a few different techniques in order to categorize websites
  where we serve ads including from our ML model, our previous more naive model,
  and in some cases from publishers themselves.
  Now that we're pretty happy with our ML model, we are going to make a few tweaks
  that will result in better targeting results for our advertisers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are also working on some minor UX improvements to our ad server for advertisers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="january-advertising-stats"&gt;January advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2023:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$32,078.53&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;147 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;12,686,867&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we expected from the guidance in our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2023/01/ethicalads-newsletter-december-2022/"&gt;December newsletter&lt;/a&gt;,
January was a rough month for advertising and losing one of our biggest clients will do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we expect February to be a significantly better month from an ad sales perspective
although not as good as some of our best months ever at the end of last year.
With the price reduction we put in place for Q1, we have multiple advertisers
increasing the size of their campaigns.
While ad budgets are tight and despite economic gloom in the news,
we haven't seen that much spillover into actual campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap for February:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We aim to update our advertiser guide with more examples of successful ads
  and concrete ways to track and measure the success of your ad campaigns
  (without compromising privacy).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We aim to support GitHub Sponsors as a payout option for open source projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are working on some changes to how we pace ads over the day and over a campaign.
  We believe there are a number of optimizations to help campaigns perform a little better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're considering additional product changes that help advertisers optimize their campaigns effectively on our platform over the length of the campaign.&lt;/li&gt;

If you need some convincing, check out our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/10/privacy-teardown-search-engines/"&gt;privacy teardown on search engines&lt;/a&gt; from a few months ago

Nobody wants their personal information siphoned off to companies they've never heard of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to highlight some other issues in the minefield that is adtech
and we have some recommendations to keep you safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="malware-in-advertising"&gt;Malware in advertising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days of ad networks running scripts on behalf of advertisers
that made cross-site scripting vulnerabilities (XSS) trivial are mostly gone.
However, that doesn't mean that security issues around advertising have also gone the way of MySpace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very recent trend is malvertising: real advertisers paying to promote malware,
ransomware, or spyware. These kinds of ads usually target people searching for software to install
especially things like developer tools, password managers, and cryptocurrency wallets.
In some cases, the ad landing page which serves the malware is even designed or named to mimic its real counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage text-center"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-50 shadow-lg" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2023-malvertising-on-google.png" alt="Malware being advertised ('malvertising') in Google search ads"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Malware being advertised ("malvertising") in Google search ads in January 2023. &lt;br&gt;Credit: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1616565189754900480" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;MalwareHunterTeam on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's been a big uptick in this kind of advertising over the last month.
While I expect Google and domain registrars will clamp down on the worst offenders pretty quickly,
these kinds of issues resurface periodically both on Google and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-2018, for example, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/7648803"&gt;Google kicked off some cryptocurrency advertisers&lt;/a&gt; for promoting ICOs, untrusted wallets, and unlicensed option trading.
Many of those same advertisers just went to less discerning networks to keep doing the same thing.
Our own network had a massive uptick in prospects interested in blockchain advertising that week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-to-keep-yourself-safe"&gt;How to keep yourself safe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage text-center"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-50 shadow-lg" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2023-ad-blocker-meme.jpg" alt="Even people working in the ad industry protect themselves"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even people working in the ad industry protect themselves. &lt;br&gt;Credit: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/yrrmsn/i_feel_seen/" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;/r/adops on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be a bit strange for an ad company like us to recommend this,
but tracker blockers or ad blockers are a great way to keep yourself private and safe
from malware or scams in advertising.
Last month, we had a post for privacy week
where we &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2023/01/data-privacy-week-2023-privacy-first-alternatives/#ad-blockers"&gt;recommended some ad and tracker blockers&lt;/a&gt;
that we use ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are definitely a bit biased since it doesn't block us (because we don't track you),
but EFF's &lt;a href="https://privacybadger.org/"&gt;Privacy Badger&lt;/a&gt; is a great tracker blocker
that works differently than most other ad blockers out there.
While it only blocks trackers, since most ads track you, it ends up blocking a lot of ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of yours and our favorite sites on the internet rely on ads to keep operating.
If you're like us, you want to support them while still protecting your privacy
and keeping yourself safe.
Despite ad blockers and tracker blockers, EthicalAds still reaches tons of developers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img class="w-75 shadow-lg" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2023-privacy-badger-notrackers.png" alt="Results of the EFF's Privacy Badger on our homepage showing no trackers"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-ethicalads-keeps-you-safe"&gt;How EthicalAds keeps you safe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our biggest advantage over the big ad networks is that because we're small,
we have a relationship with every single one of our advertisers.
This keeps our ads relevant to software development and safe from bad actors promoting malware.
It would be an impressive feat of social engineering to get a malware advertiser
onto our network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person on our team reviews every ad for new advertisers before they go live.
We also never run third-party code or serve advertiser hosted resources.
Everything is hosted on our servers.
We built this ad network to run ads on our own site Read the Docs so we completely understand
the concerns publishers have in running ads on their sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other side of this coin is that we also have also talked to and vetted every single
one of our publishers.
A member of our team checks every publisher site before paid ads go live.
Advertisers care a lot about brand safety (they tell us a lot!).
They don't want the brand they're trying to build
being promoted next to malware or questionable content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both publishers and advertisers care a lot about what they're building.
Our promise to them is that we will treat their brand the way we treat our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 63% of the browser market across devices,
Google Chrome is currently and overwelmingly the dominant web browser.
As Chrome grew, however, people became more conscious of the analytics, user profiling,
and other privacy intrusions built into it.
Maybe allowing a mega-corporation to know every single intimate detail of my life
isn't necessarily a good thing. Who knew?
Lucky for decades-long former Chrome users, there's another Chrome build which doesn't funnel
everything you've ever looked at back to the mothership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open source &lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/"&gt;Chromium&lt;/a&gt; is actually the code upon which Chrome is built.
Google maintains the codebase, documentation, and &lt;a href="https://download-chromium.appspot.com/"&gt;download site&lt;/a&gt;,
but as open source projects are wont to do,
Chromium has expanded into hundreds if not thousands of splinter projects and companies.
There's an entire section on the Chromium wikipedia page featuring the largest &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Browsers_based_on_Chromium"&gt;browsers based on Chromium&lt;/a&gt;.
Many of which are privacy-focused browsers like &lt;a href="https://brave.com/"&gt;Brave&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/"&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.avast.com/secure-browser"&gt;Avast Secure Browser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EthicalAds team relies on Firefox and Chromium.
On mobile, DuckDuckGo has a &lt;a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app"&gt;mobile browser&lt;/a&gt;
with some intelligent tracker blocking built-in to keep you safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ad-blockers"&gt;Ad Blockers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About as important as the browser itself, are the additional privacy add-ons
that keep you safe from ads and trackers.
Many people like myself used &lt;a href="https://adblockplus.org/"&gt;AdBlockPlus&lt;/a&gt; for years without much thought.
It's a simple, effective service which gives you control over not only which websites are allowed to show ads,
but it even allows you to allow list certain YouTube and Twitch channels to run their ads
so you can support your favorite creators.
The creators of AdBlockPlus have gone on to form the &lt;a href="https://acceptableads.com/about/"&gt;Acceptable Ads Committee&lt;/a&gt;
who's &lt;a href="https://acceptableads.com/standard/"&gt;Acceptable Ads Standard&lt;/a&gt; we follow
as EthicalAds believes in their mission of creating a sustainable compromise between user preference and creator monetization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, by default AdBlockPlus permits "Acceptable Ads" that &lt;a href="https://help.getadblock.com/support/solutions/articles/6000224547-about-acceptable-ads-and-third-party-tracking/"&gt;use third-party tracking&lt;/a&gt;.
The standard for an unacceptable ad is largely focused on how annoying an ad is to the user experience
as opposed to the detrimental effects of &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/surveillance-advertising/?ref=data-privacy-day-2022"&gt;surveillance advertising&lt;/a&gt; as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative, some of our team relies on &lt;a href="https://privacybadger.org/"&gt;Privacy Badger&lt;/a&gt;.
Privacy Badger is a browser extension from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, that isn't even an ad blocker.
It only blocks &lt;em&gt;trackers&lt;/em&gt;.
However, since most ad networks track users, it ends up blocking most ads (but not us).
Privacy Badger also &lt;a href="https://privacybadger.org/#How-does-Privacy-Badger-work"&gt;doesn't rely&lt;/a&gt; on suppression lists which is how most ad blockers work.
Instead, it learns based on the sites you visit which sites are tracking you across domains and then
either blocks requests to those sites completely or just disables them from storing cookies or other storage like local storage.
Privacy Badger is supported on Firefox, Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera so if you're running one of those, definitely check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="search-engines"&gt;Search Engines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out our posts from last year on
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/11/best-search-engines-for-your-privacy/"&gt;the best search engines for your privacy&lt;/a&gt;
and a &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/10/privacy-teardown-search-engines/"&gt;privacy teardown of common search engines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When thinking of privacy-first search engines,
your first thought may be &lt;a href="https://duckduckgo.com/"&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt; and for good reason.
They've been a thought leader in the privacy-first movement since their founding in 2008 and
have staked claim that search engines don't have to track users to be profitable.
I'd especially like to shoutout their great blog called &lt;a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/"&gt;Spread Privacy&lt;/a&gt; which is filled with
bite-sized articles on everything from personally actionable privacy tips
to digests on the latest results from the privacy-focused research they're conducting.
Not to mention how DuckDuckGo's supported the movement financially with &lt;a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/2021-duckduckgo-donations/"&gt;over $1,000,000 donated&lt;/a&gt;
to privacy and competition organizations in 2021 alone.
DuckDuckGo is obviously a great pick for any privacy-concious netizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are a number of other great search engines that respect your privacy.
Late last year, we did a &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/11/best-search-engines-for-your-privacy/"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;
of a number of a number of search engines from a data privacy perspective.
Between &lt;a href="https://www.mojeek.com/"&gt;Mojeek&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://search.brave.com/"&gt;Brave Search&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://you.com/"&gt;You.com's search engine&lt;/a&gt;
(their developer-focused search engine &lt;a href="https://you.com/code"&gt;YouCode&lt;/a&gt; is fantastic),
there's a number of great alternatives to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage text-center"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-75 shadow-lg" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2022-search-engine-privacy-youcom.png" alt="Details of Python's hashlib in YouCode search"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="analytics"&gt;Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a crucial step in building our own privacy-first, &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/10/building-an-ethical-marketing-funnel/"&gt;ethical marketing funnel&lt;/a&gt;,
we evaluated a number of Google Analytics alternatives.
Specifically we wanted to support open-source organizations
that specialize in anoniminity-preserving aggregation algorithms
for measuring inbound referrals in order to respect the privacy of our site visitor's data.
In order to meet these criteria, we researched dozens of platforms and
narrowed our favorites down to two excellent companies,
Plausible and SimpleAnalytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We at EthicalAds use &lt;a href="https://plausible.io/"&gt;Plausible&lt;/a&gt; as our analytics provider
for a number of reasons including their comprehensive, yet elegant single page displays,
their user-agnostic aggregation methods as outlined in their informative &lt;a href="https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics"&gt;privacy statement&lt;/a&gt;,
and most importantly their commitment to maintaining not only their &lt;a href="https://plausible.io/open-source-website-analytics"&gt;open source platform&lt;/a&gt;
but also their &lt;a href="https://plausible.io/docs"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; (a cause near and dear to our hearts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding privacy-focused analytics has empowered us to take a more data-backed approach to our growth.
We now assess the conversion rates of our A/B test variants for various house ads, landing page SEO-tweaks, as well as our other media inbounds
in order to direct more time and resources to whichever growth channels are proving most effective,
all &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; compromising the personal information of our visitors.
That being said, Plausible has only a limited-time free trial period and so isn't necessarily a perfect fit for
up-and-coming open source developers, technical tutorial creators, or data is beautiful enthusiasts who have yet to monetize their growing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where our second privacy-preserving analytics recommendation shines.
&lt;a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/?ref=ethicalads-blog"&gt;Simple Analytics&lt;/a&gt; is a privacy-first analytics product designed specifically for &lt;em&gt;developers&lt;/em&gt;. Sound familiar?
The resonance between the EthicalAds' &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/?ref=data-privacy-day-2022"&gt;Our Ad Vision&lt;/a&gt; and
Simple Analytics' &lt;a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/our-promise"&gt;Our Promise&lt;/a&gt; page is astounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data privacy week is relatively new,
but we are thrilled to be in the privacy-first movement,
and happy to take the opportunity to shed a spotlight on some other privacy-first projects who are doing great things.
We've only scratched the surface of the privacy-tech ecosystem here,
but every single product discussed has been used by one of us at EthicalAds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
Please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@ethicalads.io"&gt;email us&lt;/a&gt; if you have any privacy-first products that we should check out,
we always love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the major features we released in December:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We automated our training process for &lt;a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethicalads-model"&gt;our ML model&lt;/a&gt;
  that classifies content to help show the most relevant ad to users.
  We are using &lt;a href="https://lambdalabs.com/"&gt;LambdaLabs&lt;/a&gt; on-demand GPU instances
  to train our model whenever there are changes and a single training costs about $1.
  Full disclosure: LambdaLabs has used EthicalAds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We released our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;Q1 prospectus&lt;/a&gt;
  which included a price reduction for campaigns focusing on all developers.
  Our prices are updated quarterly based on our supply of ad space for various topics
  and the demand from our advertisers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/calculator/"&gt;campaign calculator&lt;/a&gt;
  got a few improvements to help people go from calculating to onboarded and advertising with EthicalAds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We detailed our reporting interfaces in a new &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/reporting/"&gt;landing page&lt;/a&gt;.
  Advertisers frequently ask about the kind of information they get from us
  and we want to be as upfront as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="december-advertising-stats"&gt;December advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$39,205.17&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers. This was a slight increase on November.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;148 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;19,801,179&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.
  This is a significant increase month-over-month but a lot of that is due to some lower priced
  but widely targeted campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While December held up pretty well in terms of growth, we are expecting a weaker January.
The beginning of the year is frequently a weaker time of year but we've started to see some advertisers
pull back and reduce spending.
Advertising is an easy area to cut in a tougher economic environment but it usually also comes back quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap for January:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We'll be ramping up our sales efforts in January to try to fill all of our inventory
  and this will take significant focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In January, we plan to allow a way for advertisers to get report data out of a continually updated
  Google sheet in addition to our existing API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We aim to produce a content piece about the positives and negatives (but mostly positives)
  of ad blockers and tracker blockers.
  All of our team uses some sort of blocking technology and in many ways
  it actually results in a better ad ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  They are live on our &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/@ethicalads"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the product side, we did a number of performance improvements to our reporting
  and offloaded more reporting to Metabase which we've
  &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/12/graphing-ad-data-at-ethicalads/"&gt;written about previously&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$38,852.04&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;148 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
  Currently, we are being very&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;17,683,179&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned last month, we expected November to be slightly weaker
than the record months we had in September and October.
The end of the year is usually a little weaker both in terms of supply
(folks go on vacations and thus don't view ads) and demand,
but so far things are holding up well by comparison to previous years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap for December:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are still aiming to get our GPU model building with a CI service.
  This would mean retraining and updating the model anytime
  we add new hand categorized data to our data set.
  This tight feedback loop will create a flywheel to help our model get better more rapidly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will have a Q1 prospectus with updated pricing early in the month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're aiming to integrate parts of our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/calculator/"&gt;campaign calculator&lt;/a&gt;
  into our onboarding process to help advertisers plan and start their first campaign.&lt;/li&gt;

Last month, we did a &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/10/privacy-teardown-search-engines/"&gt;privacy teardown&lt;/a&gt; of some large search engines as well as the more privacy minded ones.
Based on our results, we're prepared to make a few recommendations and offer a few tips to keep you safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="privacy-search-engine-landscape"&gt;Privacy search engine landscape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of privacy concerns when searching online:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big tech companies store search data on millions of individuals including you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can be shown personalized results that keep you in a sort of exposure bubble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's also worries about data sharing with third-parties you have no relationship with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there's a lot of great alternatives and the right one depends on exactly what you're looking for in a search engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="duckduckgo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://duckduckgo.com/"&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage text-center"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-75 shadow-lg" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2022-search-engine-privacy-duckduckgo.png" alt="DuckDuckGo - a privacy search engine"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;DuckDuckGo search engine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DuckDuckGo has become synonymous, at least among techies, as the private alternative to Google.
The search engine and the company has built their brand on privacy.
In our teardown, DuckDuckGo scored top marks for a lack of cookies and persistent storage and no third-party requests.
It's just a few clicks away to make it your browser's default search engine,
and when the results aren't quite what you're looking for, you can prefix your query with &lt;code&gt;!g&lt;/code&gt; to search Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user experience is fantastic and they have mobile apps for Android and iOS as well as a Mac desktop app.
The mobile app on Android can also double as tracker protection even for requests made in other apps.
By using Bing's search index under the hood, the search results are pretty close to Google's in quality.
&lt;strong&gt;DuckDuckGo is a great overall choice for a private search engine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mojeek"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mojeek.com/"&gt;Mojeek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage text-center"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-75 shadow-lg" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2022-search-engine-privacy-mojeek.png" alt="Mojeek, an independent search engine"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mojeek, an independent search engine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mojeek is a UK-based search engine that has built their own search index rather than using Bing's like many of the others here (Mojeek has advertised with EthicalAds in the past).
In our teardown, Mojeek was fantastic and didn't share any data, had no requests blocked by ad blockers,
and in fact, the whole search engine homepage and results page loaded everything from a single domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the search engine results page is a bit spartan,
it loads very fast and the actual result quality was pretty good.
&lt;strong&gt;If you're looking for an independent search engine that doesn't rely on big tech at all,
Mojeek is amazing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="youcom"&gt;&lt;a href="https://you.com/code"&gt;You.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage text-center"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-75 shadow-lg" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2022-search-engine-privacy-youcom.png" alt="Details of Python's hashlib in YouCode search"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Details of Python's hashlib in YouCode search&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You.com allows you to customize your search experience
by showing results from common websites you visit
(You.com has advertised with EthicalAds in the past).
One big advantage that comes from these integrations is that it can function as a great developer search engine
and that's why the team built YouCode search.
YouCode integrates results from common developer sites like StackOverflow
and Read the Docs, the parent of EthicalAds, directly onto the search engine results screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I couldn't find details on You.com's search index, based on their search results,
it's clear that at least in some queries You.com is relying on Bing's index.
That means that the result quality will stay high.
In our privacy teardown, You.com and YouCode got close to top marks.
&lt;strong&gt;For a search engine tuned for developer queries, You.com and specifically YouCode is a good choice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="brave-search"&gt;&lt;a href="https://search.brave.com/"&gt;Brave Search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage text-center"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-75 shadow-lg" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2022-search-engine-privacy-brave.png" alt="Brave search"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Brave search&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brave is a search engine from the folks who created the Brave Browser.
In our teardown, its results were perfect with no cookies, trackers, third-parties, or any other privacy violations.
Like Mojeek but unlike the rest of the bunch, Brave has built their own search index
although in some cases they claim to mix their results with Bing's.
Despite mostly relying on its own search index, I was pretty impressed with the search result quality and order
even when compared to Bing itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like DuckDuckGo, Brave has desktop and mobile apps so you can search privately everywhere.
They claim not to store searches, clicks, or any other data and allow truly anonymous searches.
Brave specifically mentions that they do not filter or downrank any search results.
&lt;strong&gt;For a good alternative from a team focused on privacy, you can't go wrong with Brave Search.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="other-alternatives"&gt;Other alternatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage text-center"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;SwissCows search engine homepage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are even more privacy-focused search engines that we did not detail in our privacy teardown.
You might consider these search engines if you have particular concerns about data jurisdiction.
From a quality perspective, most of these search engines rely on search indexes from other search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://swisscows.com/"&gt;SwissCows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - SwissCows is a Swiss-hosted search engine that like DuckDuckGo uses Bing's index to fulfill search queries. It claims its results are "family friendly" and that they do not store any user data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.qwant.com/"&gt;Qwant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Qwant is a French search engine that also uses Bing's search index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://searx.info/"&gt;Searx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Searx is an open source meta search engine that relies on results from other search engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="recommendations"&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you have specific concerns,
you can't go too far wrong with any of these privacy-minded alternatives.
As an every day search engine, DuckDuckGo is popular with the EthicalAds and Read the Docs teams
while respecting your privacy.
For a search engine completely separate from the tech titans, try Mojeek or Brave Search
and for a more developer focused search experience, both You.com and DuckDuckGo are great.&lt;/p&gt;

but it was our best month ever except for September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the major features we released in October:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We released a &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/calculator/"&gt;campaign calculator&lt;/a&gt;
  to help advertisers budget for a campaign based on the responses they're hoping to achieve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We did our first &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/10/privacy-teardown-search-engines/"&gt;privacy teardown of search engines&lt;/a&gt;.
  Depending on the response we get, we think this could be a series of posts
  to educate audiences on what to look for in services from a privacy perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our GPU trained contextual targeting model rolled out into production in October.
  So far, the results are much better than the previous iteration.
  There were some performance issues taking the model from development into production,
  but those were worked out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We announced our
  &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/11/python-software-foundation-ethicalads-working-to-promote-open-source-sponsorship/"&gt;partnership with the PSF&lt;/a&gt;
  to help them manage and roll out their sponsors logos and imagery to all their properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest server updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-client changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="october-advertising-stats"&gt;October advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$45,511.07&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers. This was our second highest publisher revenue month after September&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;152 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.
  This number continues to creep up as more sites become interested in making money without invasive tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;20,236,866&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I expected, October was a very strong month for us and for our publishers.
We usually see a seasonal slowdown around the holidays and between fewer ads shown over the Thanksgiving holiday
in the US and other seasonal pullback, we expect November to be a quite bit weaker than October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've definitely seen some advertisers tighten their budgets as well and that's further contributing to a weaker finish to the year.
Usually advertising is back to full swing in January or February,
but outside of the brief Covid crash in March 2020,
we haven't operated through a true downturn.
Regardless, we can weather an economic downturn if it comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap for November:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a content marketing perspective, we're planning to do a followup post
  on our privacy teardown of search engines,
  a post with details about how our ML model works,
  and a blog detailing how ad blockers can actually help a privacy-focused network like ours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the product side, we're hoping to get a continuous integration service configured
  for our GPU trained model. This would mean retraining and updating the model anytime
  we add new hand categorized data to our data set.
  This tight feedback loop will create a flywheel to help our model get better more rapidly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.

advancements in machine learning have made a new era of content-based ad targeting possible.
Computers …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the past few years,
advancements in machine learning have made a new era of content-based ad targeting possible.
Computers are now stunningly good at learning how to categorize documents,
which allows us to automate and scale content-based targeting to our entire network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will cover how our content-based targeting works at a high level,
and the implications for the future growth of our business.
Building great privacy-first ad targeting helps the industry move past the era of invasive user tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-problem-grouping-targeting"&gt;The problem: grouping &amp;amp; targeting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building an ad network requires us to serve ads across a number of different sites with differing content.
Many of these sites have content that focuses on a number of different topics.
You can imagine a blog with both Python and Kubernetes content,
and the audience for each of those posts is different.
&lt;strong&gt;Each page of content that we serve should have targeting based on what it's about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other major problem is trying to find ways to bundle content together,
so that advertisers can buy a large amount of it.
If we can only offer $100 a month of a very specific audience,
that doesn't scale very effectively.
&lt;strong&gt;We need a way to easily bundle content into high-level topics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="our-original-approach-using-naive-tags"&gt;Our original approach: using naive tags&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first approach to solving this problem was based on tagging.
Many publishers manually added tags to their content,
and we allowed them to pass these to us in our ad client.
Our ad client also created tags based on related words appearing multiple times on a page.
Then we grouped a set of keywords together to make topics,
so for example our &lt;em&gt;Data Science&lt;/em&gt; topic was made of &lt;code&gt;nlp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jupyter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pytorch&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tensorflow&lt;/code&gt;, and similar keywords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach allowed us to build out our initial product,
and have reasonably good targeting.
It had a few drawbacks though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It needed users to tag content, and most pages aren't tagged (eg. software documentation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We needed to combine tags into topics, and there will always be some tags we don't know about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The automatic tagging was quite naive, and had some false positives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to build a more robust solution that was able to understand a lot more about each page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-solution-machine-learning"&gt;The solution: machine learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have implemented a machine learning model that is able to categorize pages based on past content it has seen.
This process is started with an initial set of human categorized data.
Then we pass in data the model hasn't seen before,
and grade it based on how good it scores these topics.
Those grades are then used to update the model,
and it does this thousands of times,
creating the best possible guess for a piece of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we "train" the ML model,
it is mapping all the various words and phrases in a document into the topic we've assigned the page.
So for example,
the model learns that "natural language processing" on a page means it's highly likely related to &lt;em&gt;Data Science&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;strong&gt;The magic of the model is that it understands a massive number of words and phrases,
many more than we could ever add manually.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ML-based model has the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The model scales across any technical content that was pass in, without requiring page authors to do anything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It takes into account the entire page content, and word context, to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can easily add more topics, as long as we can categorize a small number of pages of content that belong to that topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're excited to expand our ML targeting in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="next-steps-more-topics-and-more-privacy"&gt;Next steps: more topics and more privacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ease of adding new topics to our models allows us to continue to expand the topics we're able to target.
In the future,
if an advertiser comes to us wanting to target a specific subset of content,
we should be able to train a deploy this targeting within a week.
We can also scale down into smaller niches,
because we are able to find all the content within our network that matches more specific topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're excited about this approach,
and hope that improving content-based ad targeting will remove the incentives to track users.
There is a long way to go on our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/"&gt;vision for privacy-first ads&lt;/a&gt;,
but we think that our machine learning approach is a scalable foundation to build on.&lt;/p&gt;

The PSF is using EthicalAds to power their sponsor …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're excited to announce a partnership with the &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/psf/"&gt;Python Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.
The PSF is using EthicalAds to power their sponsor promotion across their ecosystem of web properties:
helping them deliver value to their sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously the PSF was just putting static images for their sponsors on their web pages.
This was done manually,
and required a deploy of their website in order to get changes.
This required multiple members of the team to coordinate,
and resulted in lag time for getting sponsors on the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSF was looking for a way to promote their sponsors across a number of web properties,
but have a single management and reporting mechanism.
EthicalAds was a great solution for this,
since we have a simple javascript client facilitate the sponsorship displays.
The PSF also wanted to keep track of how many times each sponsor image has been seen and viewed.
Having metrics allows them to quantify the value they are delivering their sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-solution"&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSF started with the sites that are already included in their sponsorship prospectus.
They were able to integrate our ad client,
and manage the targeting on the backend of our ad server.
The properties we are currently implementing sponsorship on are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/1.26.7/#changes"&gt;Python Package Index&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/psf/sponsors/"&gt;PSF sponsor listing page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div style="width: 300px; margin: 2rem auto;"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-100" src="/theme/img/example-ads/aws-psf.png" alt="Example PSF placement"&gt;
  &lt;p class="text-center"&gt;&lt;small&gt;PyPI sponsorship placement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the PyPI integration looks similar to our normal ad placements,
where the PSF sponsors page has a custom look and feel.
We are able to customize each of the placements used in our sponsorship platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re happy to use EthicalAds for sponsor recognition across our web properties with centralized management and respect for privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ee Durbin, Director of Infrastructure, Python Software Foundation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new ability to show sponsorship logos on all of their properties,
the PSF will be able to expand where sponsors are shown.
All of these different integrations are also able to provide view &amp;amp; click statistics,
without requiring any cookies by the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the major features we released in September:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We released a couple cool pieces of content including a retrospective
  in dealing with some
  &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/09/watch-out-ad-scammers-are-impersonating-open-source-devs/"&gt;ad scammers impersonating open source developers&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/10/privacy-teardown-search-engines/"&gt;privacy teardown of search engines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We released our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;Q4 prospectus&lt;/a&gt;.
  One significant change here was to further breakdown prices in Europe
  so we can deliver advertisers exactly what they're looking for at a fair price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the suggestions we got about our contextual targeting model was to spend more time and resources
  on training. As a result, we trained a version in the cloud on GPUs and it does seem to perform
  quite a bit better. That effort started last month and should roll out in October.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest server updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-client changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="september-advertising-stats"&gt;September advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$47,493.48&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers. This was our highest publisher revenue month ever!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;145 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;21,384,298&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our big push on marketing in August really paid dividends in September.
Last month, I suggested that September would be a very good month and it was a record by all our metrics.
I don't expect October to be quite as good as September for a few reasons, but it will still be a very
strong month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap for October:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We plan to put our GPU-trained model into production.
  In testing, it has shown considerably improved accuracy over our existing model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are creating a campaign pricing calculator to help advertisers put together a campaign
  that meets their advertising goals and their budget.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This month, both Eric and I will be at Djangocon US in San Diego.
  If you're coming to the conference, please stop by and say hello!&lt;/li&gt;

What about search engines that claim not to track you?
In this privacy teardown, we use off-the-shelf tools, data,
and methods to see how traditional and more privacy-focused search engines treat and share your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#results"&gt;Skip to the results&lt;/a&gt; or skip to our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/11/best-search-engines-for-your-privacy/"&gt;follow-up post with recommendations&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We selected the largest traditional search engines Google and Bing as well as a few more privacy-minded search engines like DuckDuckGo, Brave Search, Mojeek and You.com to see how they stack up and whether there was any measurable differences we could see in their data sharing (Mojeek and You.com have advertised with EthicalAds in the past but did not take part in this post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For tools, we used a number of off-the-shelf tools and data sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/"&gt;The Markup&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit news source that looks at how Big Tech uses technology,
  produced a tool called &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;. Blacklight looks for third-party cookies, known trackers, non-cookie tracking methods, session or keystroke capturing tech, and other third-party pixels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://duckduckgo.com/"&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;, one of the search engines we're analyzing, produces a data set called &lt;a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-radar"&gt;Tracker Radar&lt;/a&gt; used by their own mobile browsers, browser extensions, and other tools. Tracker Radar has data on the most common trackers, what they're used for, and a way to group trackers by their parent entity (eg. Doubleclick, GoogleAnalytics, and YouTube are all Google). For our test, we checked Tracker Radar through the &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg"&gt;DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials&lt;/a&gt; extension which also gives a letter grade (A-F) based on the requests loaded and the privacy practices as reported by &lt;a href="https://tosdr.org/"&gt;TOS;DR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://easylist.to/"&gt;The Easylist&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest ad blocker lists used by ad blocking extensions like uBlock Origin and AdblockPlus, produces the EasyPrivacy list which has a huge list of trackers, analytics, and other scripts formatted for use by ad blockers. For our test, we ran uBlock Origin with an updated EasyPrivacy list and all other lists disabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/"&gt;EFF&lt;/a&gt; produces a browser extension called &lt;a href="https://privacybadger.org/"&gt;Privacy Badger&lt;/a&gt; which is an algorithmic tracker blocker. Rather than relying on a list of domains or scripts (like EasyPrivacy or Tracker Radar), the extension knows what tracking looks like and blocks trackers when it sees them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We did a brief manual inspection looking at all third-party and subdomain requests as well as cookies and persistent storage. This was a sanity check in case the search engines are handling different requests differently and also to do a quick DNS lookup on subdomains looking for CNAME cloaking, a way to hide third-party trackers as first-party requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each search engine, we loaded the homepage and a search engine results page (SERP).

&lt;p&gt;One caveat to our analysis is that not all tracking can be seen by these methods.
For example, Google could use search history data in their other products without using any third-party trackers
since they are the &lt;em&gt;first-party&lt;/em&gt; when you search Google.
Since data is transmitted to the servers of these search engines, there's no way to tell what their servers do with the data beyond their privacy policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracker Radar&lt;/strong&gt;: Grade D (poor privacy practices). Blocked requests to doubleclick.net and googleadservices.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EasyPrivacy&lt;/strong&gt;: Blocked requests to doubleclick.net and googleadservices.com. Continued to block additional logging requests as long as the tab was in focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PrivacyBadger&lt;/strong&gt;: Blocked requests to doubleclick.net&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual Inspection&lt;/strong&gt;: Loaded resources from google.com subdomains, doubleclick.net (Google ads), gstatic.com, and ytimg.com (YouTube). All of these resolved to Google's infrastructure. Persisted long term (over 1 year) cookies on a few google.com subdomains and used local storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Google appears to be sharing data with other Google properties but not with any third-parties.
Google does persist long-term unique identifiers even for logged out users simply doing a query or loading the homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bing"&gt;Bing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blacklight&lt;/strong&gt;: No trackers. Third-party cookies detected for "login.microsoftonline.com". No keystroke or session capturing found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracker Radar&lt;/strong&gt;: C+ (unknown privacy practices). The Bing homepage had a few requests blocked after scrolling including requests to outbrain.com and zemanta.com, two adtech companies. Tracker Radar noted but did not block requests to Akamai. Repeated homepage loads produced slightly different results. The SERP page reported no trackers and no third-party requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EasyPrivacy&lt;/strong&gt;: Blocked numerous requests to both Microsoft and third-party domains (10-15% of requests) on the homepage. Continued to block additional requests to Bing as long as the tab was in focus. The SERP page only blocked what appeared to be logging requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PrivacyBadger&lt;/strong&gt;: On the homepage, allowed a request to akamaized.net. After scrolling on the homepage, blocked requests to cheqzone.com, outbrain.com, and zemanta.com. No trackers found on the SERP page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual Inspection&lt;/strong&gt;: Loaded resources from many domains including msn.com subdomains, virtualearth.net (Bing maps), akamaized.net, and cloudfront.net. The one standout request was to trace.mediago.io which is adtech from Baidu, a Chinese search engine. The SERP page loaded data only from bing.com subdomains and microsoft.com subdomains. All of the requests to Microsoft domains resolved to Microsoft's infrastructure. Bing persisted long term cookies on various Microsoft properties and used local storage. Firefox (our test browser) also blocked a number of third-party cookies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bing homepage loads a lot of content compared to many other search engines
including data from third-party ad tech companies. This results in some amount of data sharing.
The Bing SERP page by contrast only appears to communicate with Microsoft.
Bing persists long-term unique identifiers even for logged out users simply doing a query or loading the homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blacklight&lt;/strong&gt;: Repeated attempts on separate days to run Blacklight on Brave Search timed out. It is possible that Blacklight has an issue with Brave Search or that Brave is blocking Blacklight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracker Radar&lt;/strong&gt;: Grade: B+ (unknown privacy practices). No third-party requests or trackers reported on the homepage or SERP page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EasyPrivacy&lt;/strong&gt;: No requests blocked. All requests went to brave.com or a subdomain.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual Inspection&lt;/strong&gt;: Brave Search only made requests to 3 domains in total: search.brave.com, imgs.search.brave.com, and cdn.search.brave.com. None of these domains used CNAME cloaking. Brave did not persist any cookies. They did persist some data to local storage but it did not appear to contain any unique identifiers.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracker Radar&lt;/strong&gt;: Grade: B+ (unknown privacy practices). The homepage and SERP page reported third-party requests to Plausible.io, a privacy-friendly analytics company and to launchdarkly.com, a service that helps developers run A/B tests and experiments (Note: LaunchDarkly has advertised with EthicalAds) but none of these requests were blocked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EasyPrivacy&lt;/strong&gt;: Two requests blocked to a launchdarkly.com subdomain (one allowed). All other requests to you.com, a subdomain, or t-msedge.net (Microsoft's CDN).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PrivacyBadger&lt;/strong&gt;: No trackers detected on the homepage or SERP page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual Inspection&lt;/strong&gt;: You.com made requests to you.com and subdomains, plausible.io, and launchdarkly.com subdomains. None of these domains used CNAME cloaking. You.com persisted some cookies although none for more than a month. They also used local storage but it did not appear to contain any unique identifiers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You.com does load third-party resources from a small list of select partners but doesn't persist any long term unique identifiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a privacy perspective, the more privacy minded search engines
did a better job not sharing data or using long term unique identifiers (a hallmark of tracking)
than the big search engines like Google or Bing.
Google appeared to share data across Google properties but not with third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't see any of the worst practices like CNAME cloaking or logging keystrokes.
The worst practice we saw was considerable third-party data sharing with adtech companies on the Bing homepage.
By contrast, however, the Bing SERP page kept data with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the tools we used, the browser extensions did a better job of detecting all the third-party requests
than Blacklight although that isn't too surprising since we had much more control with the extensions.
The exhaustive EasyPrivacy list blocked the most requests but many of those were not third-party requests
or trackers. Both Privacy Badger and DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials/Tracker Radar did very similarly
in identifying and blocking trackers.&lt;/p&gt;

EthicalAds was targeted by an ad scam ring.
Fortunately, we were able to see through the scam quickly and to protect ourselves and our advertisers.
However, we thought this would make for an interesting post to discuss the brazen scams folks try to pull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="anatomy-of-a-scam"&gt;Anatomy of a scam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our network grows, we knew we would have a target on our back for scammers.
Since we don't track users and have pledges around what data we retain
in our &lt;a href="https://server.ethicalads.io/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt"&gt;Do Not Track policy&lt;/a&gt;,
scammers will go after us and think we're easy pickings.
When there's money to be made online, people will try to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way these scams usually work is that a person will set up a site, request an ad publisher account,
and then simulate fake traffic to the site and rake in the earnings.
We have plenty of defenses to protect ourselves from these sorts of scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably our biggest defense is our relative size to the big networks.
Unlike larger ad networks, we vet every single publisher site we onboard.
We talk to every publisher, we only do a few at most in any given week, and the process isn't automated.
A person from our team looks at our publisher sites both before and after paid ads are turned on to make sure everything looks good.
This keeps both off-topic, non-developer sites as well as outright scams off our network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we didn't expect was that we would get fake developer sites
with fake backstories applying to join our network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ad-scammers-are-brazen"&gt;Ad scammers are brazen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late July, we got some requests that appeared to come from documentation for decent sized open source libraries.
Docs sites for code modules are a natural place to put an ad in front of an engaged audience
and it puts money directly into the hands of open source maintainers.
This is our bread and butter and we built EthicalAds to do exactly this for &lt;a href="https://readthedocs.org/"&gt;Read the Docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first let one of these sites onto our network (they'd switched from a competitor),
we knew something was wrong almost immediately.
There was a little more traffic than was normal for a library like this, but a huge percentage looked automated.
We regularly look at a few internal metrics like what percentage of ads we send are viewed and how long they appear on the screen. But the metrics screamed that this new site wasn't normal traffic at all.
Within a few days, we kicked them off and refunded the small amount of traffic that got through to our advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got requests like this almost daily for weeks.
At first, we thought this example was one of a kind.
Soon, we discovered that scammers had registered similar domains to various modules' real domains,
made a sites that proxied traffic to the real library's site but could inject ads,
and created fake personas to impersonate the real library's devs:
names and emails that loosely matched one of the developers on GitHub.
There were dozens of examples but to name some specific modules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://caolan.github.io/async/v3/"&gt;AsyncJS&lt;/a&gt;  (&lt;a href="https://asyncjs.xyz/"&gt;fake mirror&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/massimocandela/dataflux"&gt;DatafluxJS&lt;/a&gt;  (&lt;a href="https://dataflux-js.xyz"&gt;fake mirror&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://noblox.js.org/"&gt;NobloxJS&lt;/a&gt;  (&lt;a href="https://nobloxjs.xyz/"&gt;fake mirror&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/toolcool-org/toolcool-color-picker"&gt;Tool Cool Color Picker&lt;/a&gt;  (&lt;a href="https://tc-color-picker.xyz/"&gt;fake mirror&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the scammers seem to have temporarily stopped applying to our network,
they created dozens of fake sites and dozens of fake personas
implying that they're doing this with some scale across other ad networks as well.
These scams weren't particularly hard to see through but were more noteworthy for how shameless they were.
In each case, the scammers were pretending to be the real developer while attemping to monetize that person's work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few examples where we could get the real developer's email address from their GitHub profile,
we emailed the developer to see if they'd heard of this "unofficial mirror",
but in each case they confirmed our suspicion that they hadn't.
These developers hadn't done anything wrong,
but most werely that surprised that somebody would try to profit from their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="keeping-our-defenses-strong"&gt;Keeping our defenses strong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to knowing we're now on the scammers' radar,
we made a few changes to make sure our network stays safe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do some additional scrutiny on the clients viewing our ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our vetting process for incoming publishers has become more formalized
  and got a few additional steps to ensure sites on our network are real and on topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We now have a system that alerts us to significant changes in traffic (quantity or quality) to a publisher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a live publisher KPIs dashboard that can show trends and key metrics for all our publishers at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we grow, size may not always be our best defense,
but we intend to make sure our network stays exclusive, secure, and high quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the marketing side, we did a &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32650878"&gt;Show HN post&lt;/a&gt;
that got a fair amount of traction
and a &lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/ethicalads"&gt;ProductHunt launch&lt;/a&gt; (that didn't).
This coincided with our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/08/going-v10-the-backstory-and-future-of-our-ad-network/"&gt;v1.0.0 release post&lt;/a&gt; that talks about our backstory and the future of our network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the other major features we released in August:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We worked quite a bit on updating our landing pages to better explain our product positioning
  as an open source, privacy-focused ad network that uses contextual (rather than behavioral) targeting.
  We added more screenshots of the product and answering more questions
  about process and reporting before they're asked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We rolled out a few advances to better detect and handle ad fraud.
  While ad fraud is part of the industry, we work very hard to minimize it from impacting our advertisers.
  We have an upcoming blog post detailing some of the blatant tactics we've seen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also in our ad server, we added a number of reporting improvements that improved performance
  and showed more of our metrics in graphical form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest server updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-client changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="august-advertising-stats"&gt;August advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$34,591.50&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;133 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;14,258,799&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in July, we saw a large advertiser scale back their marketing
and this impacted us during early to mid-August as we scrambled to fill our inventory.
Fortunately, we are now very booked up through September and a little into October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September should be close to a record month for both our revenue and payouts to publishers.
It will also feature a significant increase in paid ad views
due to a few new lower priced campaigns running with cheaper targeting options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="our-wins"&gt;Our wins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got a significant amount of inbound publishers and advertisers from our ShowHN post
and the &lt;a href="https://www.developermarkepear.com/blog/paid-advertising-developer-marketing"&gt;great review&lt;/a&gt;
from a customer last month on a developer marketing blog.
These write-ups are continuing to pay huge dividends in terms of getting the word out about us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We continued to make really good progress on our ML model for contextual targeting.
  After contacting some of the devs, we started working with one of the folks from SpaCy on a contract basis
  to help improve our model and there's been some good work started there
  that I expect to continue throughout the month.
  It always feels great to build our product while putting money directly into the hands
  of open source devs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the marketing side, we're going to produce a blog series that does privacy teardowns
  of popular websites. The first one will be in September.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It feels like 2022 is still getting started but September is time to create our Q4 prospectus already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

This release coincided with a huge upgrade to our contextual targeting, machine learning model.
We wanted to take the time to share our story of how we got here,
the details of both the software and movement we're building,
and what's coming next for EthicalAds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="our-story"&gt;Our story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years back, we were building Read the Docs, a documentation hosting platform,
but there wasn't any monetization.
It was a service with millions of monthly visitors that thousands of projects relied on for their docs
but run by folks with day jobs who wore pagers for their side project.
It wasn't sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we now have ~130 publishers and we gross just under $60k per month in ad revenue
of which 70% goes to publishers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious way to monetize was ads.
However, we cared about the privacy of our visitors
and we didn't want ad companies to track our users around the web.
We went to a few ad networks and asked if we could proxy ad traffic or even just run ads without cookies.
They laughed at us and told us to take it or leave it.
So we built our own ad network including writing our ad server and client from scratch
and did all our own sales and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to July 2020, when our friends over at CodeFund shut down, we launched our ad network.
Expanding our ads beyond Read the Docs had been on the roadmap
but CodeFund shutting down greatly accelerated our schedule
while also dropping a number of sites interested in privacy-preserving ads into our lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we now have ~130 publishers and we gross just under $60k per month in ad revenue
of which 70% goes to publishers.
Most of our publishers are small sites or open source projects so to send them ~$40k/mo feels great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="building-a-content-targeted-ad-network-with-machine-learning"&gt;Building a content-targeted ad network with machine learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we only show developer-related ads on developer sites.
No ads about a product whose site you visited last week and nothing off topic.
All our advertisers sell SaaS products for developers, cloud infrastructure,
they're hiring devs, or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All our publishers (that's advertising lingo for sites showing ads) are hand approved.
We make sure each site is the right fit for our advertisers and protect their brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"EthicalAds' targeting provides a better ad experience for our community members."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ido Shamun, Co-founder &amp;amp; CTO of daily.dev&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the basics, we built a crawler that crawls the sites on our network to help target our ads.
Using an ML classifier (built with &lt;a href="https://spacy.io/"&gt;SpaCy&lt;/a&gt;),
it can tell if a page is about data science or about full stack development.
This contextual targeting allows advertisers to reach the niche they are focused on
and ensure the ads perform well.
If you're really interested, you can try out our classifier, a part of our model,
on &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/davidfischer/ea-classifier"&gt;HuggingFace&lt;/a&gt;, a site for sharing ML models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After trying out our model and training it for a couple of months,
we were finally happy enough with the performance to integrate it into our ad serving pipeline.
We're really proud of this and that's why we went from v0.55.0 (yes, 50+ pre-stable releases) to v1.0.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-next"&gt;What's next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from privacy, one thing that separates us from the big ad players like Google and Facebook
is that they can sell ads for almost anything you can think of.
Currently, we have some traffic for a lot of developer niches,
but outside of our main &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/#audiences"&gt;audiences and topics&lt;/a&gt;,
it can be a challenge to run really focused campaigns on topics like "2 Factor Authentication"
or "Web Development with Go".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as we get larger, our contextual targeting will scale well as our network scales
and these highly focused campaigns will be possible.
It's not an understatement to say that this kind of more advanced contextual targeting is the future of EthicalAds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area we are looking at is to help &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/sponsorship-platform/"&gt;sponsorships&lt;/a&gt;
at large organizations deliver more value for sponsors.
Currently, we're helping the Python Software Foundation
to promote their sponsors across their ecosystem of web properties
while also allowing them to report important metrics like how many times a sponsor's logo was seen and clicked.
Check it our on the sidebar of the &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/#for-enterprise"&gt;Python Package Index&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="join-us-for-whats-next"&gt;Join us for what's next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're really excited about implementing new features on our ad network and continuing to iterate on sponsorships.

that enabled publishers to quickly and easily add a floating, text-only ad placement
fixed to their site footer without having to write custom code.
Ensuring an ad is unobtrusive, visible,
and fits with the rest of a website goes a long way toward having good ad performance.
By having a well-tested, high-performing placement out of the box,
we can help publishers get something that works well quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="usage"&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature is available to any publisher who wants to use it
by setting the &lt;code&gt;data-ea-style="fixedfooter"&lt;/code&gt; attribute on their ad placement.
The mobile and desktop optimized ad is displayed without an image
and only takes up a minimal amount of real estate on the page.
See our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#fixedfooter"&gt;full documentation&lt;/a&gt; on the feature for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of publishers had requested this feature and a few had built it themselves
for their own site and we wanted to have a base implementation available for all our publishers.
Already we've been recommending it to some new and a few existing publishers
and we've seen a number of them choose use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are features you're interested to see in our ad client,

&lt;p&gt;These are the major features we released in July:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our machine learning model that analyzes the content around where our ads appear
  so we can show the best possible ad rolled into production.
  Showing the best possible ad makes more money for publishers and shows advertisers' ads
  in the right context to perform amazingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our ad client, we released an
  &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#fixedfooter"&gt;ad fixed to the footer&lt;/a&gt;.
  Already a number of publishers have chosen it and it performs great!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/#audiences"&gt;audiences section&lt;/a&gt;,
  we added some details of the top publishers across our network
  for each of the major topics we focus on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest server updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-client changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="july-advertising-stats"&gt;July advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$35,670.95&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;131 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;14,563,179&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to see strong demand for advertising and these figures are just below
our all time records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="our-wins"&gt;Our wins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We received &lt;a href="https://www.developermarkepear.com/blog/paid-advertising-developer-marketing"&gt;a very nice review&lt;/a&gt;
from a customer on a developer marketing blog
that has resulted in a significant number of advertiser prospects asking for more information.
There's truly no greater praise than a customer telling others about us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For August, we did see a large advertiser reduce spending
and we expect a small slowdown over the month.
We have 3-4 advertisers who each account for about 10% of our total revenue
and losing one of them results in unsold inventory.
Running an ad network is always a balance between supply of ad placements
and demand for developer eyeballs and finding that balance can be tricky
especially since advertising is usually not sold in contracts longer than a quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We received some &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AsiaOrangio/status/1552277640953745408"&gt;great feedback&lt;/a&gt;
  on our product positioning and landing pages and we are working to improve our marketing
  and positioning in August.
  We are also reading a book on positioning
  (&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45166937-obviously-awesome"&gt;"Obviously Awesome"&lt;/a&gt; for the curious)
  in our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/05/running-a-company-book-club-tips-what-we-read/"&gt;company book club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In August, we dealt with a fair amount of ad scammers testing our defenses.
  Fortunately, we were able to discover them quickly and protect ourselves and our advertisers.
  This is a constant battle and hopefully we can share some of what we've learned
  and some of the brazen tactics from the scammers in an upcoming post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We plan on making a number of improvements to our ad reporting for advertisers
  including speeding up performance and showing more graphs, maps, and charts
  to help make sense of all the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the major features we released in June:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made a number of improvements to detecting keywords where we show ads.
  In the end, this project scoped up a little bit and we built a pretty awesome (for us anyway)
  machine learning model that detects what pages are about.
  It will roll into production in July.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We rolled out an updated &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;Q3 prospectus&lt;/a&gt;
  and a small simplification to our pricing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We released a new &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/06/publisher-spotlight-series-kyle-polich-from-data-skeptic/"&gt;publisher spotlight interview&lt;/a&gt;
  with Kyle Polich from Data Skeptic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just to follow up on a May feature, we saw quite a few publishers start using the fallback ads!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="june-advertising-stats"&gt;June advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$37,579.32&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.
  This is slightly down from our record month in May but still very good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;128 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;15,407,959&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of talk of a market downturn but that hasn't shown up yet
in our numbers. We are continuing to see strong demand for advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we're pretty excited about the ML model we built,
we don't have a true data scientist at EthicalAds or at Read the Docs.
As a result, there's been quite a ramp up in terms of learning the ML state of the art.
We have created a &lt;a href="https://spacy.io/"&gt;SpaCy&lt;/a&gt; based text classifier.
This is tricky because it's outside of our comfort zone,
but to go from almost nothing to something just about ready for production
in less than a month is very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I mentioned earlier, our topic detection project will roll out in July.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm a little late in posting this blog but we released support
  for an &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#fixedfooter"&gt;ad fixed to the footer&lt;/a&gt;
  of the page directly to our ad client in early July.
  This allows publishers to have a high performing ad placement without any custom code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are building topic specific landing pages for our core topics
  like data science and security &amp;amp; privacy. The goal is to help our SEO and rank for things
  advertisers search for like "advertising to data scientists".&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part of our publisher spotlight series where we highlight publishers
using EthicalAds and help them tell their story.
This second episode is with Kyle Polich from &lt;a href="https://dataskeptic.com/"&gt;Data Skeptic&lt;/a&gt;,
a podcast about data science, machine learning, and AI.
You can check out our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/01/publisher-spotlight-series-ido-shamun-from-dailydev/"&gt;previous episode here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ra: Hi I'm Ra from EthicalAds and firstly I'd like to introduce my guest who is Kyle Polich,
the producer of Data Skeptic podcast, a podcast all about innovations in data science.
So Kyle, can you tell me what is Data Skeptic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle: Well it really started out as kind of my passion
project wanting to do some science communication about the field of
data science and you know my broader interests in computer
science and AI and machine learning and topics like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's evolved into a show that's run by a small team of people and I get to host it
where every week I tend to talk
to someone who's done some interesting either research
which is mostly our focus or sometimes
industry or just interesting data related project.
Usually correlating with whatever our current season's theme is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell me a little bit more about how you choose a theme for the season?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well it's kind of an evolving process.
I started doing that only a few years into the show and I
really like it as the format it helps me kind of focus on
getting deep into one topic instead of just you know,
buffet-style sampling everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's kind of a combination of what I think is most
interesting to me at the moment if I'm feeling selfish or what I
think is important in the public consciousness or just a really good topic
that there isn't enough information available about if I'm feeling more generous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, so
you started Data Skeptic almost for your own curiosity.
But it sounds like you've transformed it almost
into like a platform to raise awareness for,
data science research or important things going
on in the data literate community,
I'm going to say.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, it's such an evolving field, so much has happened in the last,
even in the time I've been doing Data Skeptic.
Natural language processing is revolutionized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I studied it in grad school and I'm not
gonna say everything I learned there was useless,
but like we use completely different techniques that didn't exist then.
So the challenge to stay up with the
literature is a great sort of exercise for me that
I get from doing the show
and I get the joy of sharing that with all the listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, it seems
like everyone has a podcast these days.
I mean we have one right now basically.
So what kind of sets Data Skeptic apart from the zeitgeist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a good question. I think of it as Data Skeptic, a sort of our own stage.
We're not a big corporate backed media giant that
gets featured on the front page of ITunes.
People hear about us, word of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know, if there were an analogy to like music and music venues,
I'm an underground club where I feature upcoming acts that
maybe you haven't heard of yet so well there,
you know, do you have to have some sort of celebrity status names on the show.
I try and interview guests that I think are doing really cutting
edge things that are going to become more prevalent in the future.
So I'd like to think we're sort of the underground opening act for big things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I've noticed you feature a lot of PhD students or candidates even on your program,
which I greatly admire, because at the end of the day,
PhD students are often times the boots on the ground,
if not the first name on the paper.
Has like providing a platform for these up and coming data stars,
crossed your mind at the origins of Data Skeptic,
or is that something that kind of developed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's just been a side bonus.
I didn't really anticipate that when I started the
show and knowing I wanted to do it weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly,
my early motivations and and concerns were really about
can I keep up the pace of the content?
And as I kind of jumped that hurdle, then it became more about like,
what is the platform really for my gosh, we actually have listeners,
what do they want to hear and how do we make
this continue to grow and still stay true to itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell me a little bit about your audience and who, I mean,
there are people who, you know, heard about it from a fellow data enthusiast,
but like who are your audience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it's a pretty diverse group.
I mean, you can make some broad assumptions and you'll probably be correct,
you know, right, people working in data careers or adjacent to those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've done some surveys over time to get a better sense of this.
So I would say it's, it's a lot broader umbrella than you might think.
It's not that 80% of listeners have the title data scientist.
Some are entrepreneurs who
maybe you are never going to build a machine learning model,
but they want to know what's going on in ML because it could impact their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think the commonality I find is just a good curiosity and
that's what I appreciate and try and deliver on for listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That makes a lot of sense.
Especially when thinking about the potential corporate
benefits of bringing ML into business.
It's a frequent joke where the CDO of the company will say,
can we use machine learning for this?
And the good engineer will say no, it doesn't make sense.
And the great engineer will say yes, but I'll need a raise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how large is your listener base on like a monthly basis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I don't want to give you a flippant answer, but when we crossed,
I think 10 million total downloads, I stopped looking at the stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's amazing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you. We've been doing it for many years.
So the more episodes you put out, you know,
it's not as impressive as if I had put out five episodes,
but very proud of what we've accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There came a point when,
especially as we started introducing advertisers on the show,
that there was a push and pull, you know,
should we cover things that would get us
higher paying advertisers or things like that?
And I did not want us to become overly metrics driven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've helped a lot of businesses do that and
that's really the right thing for a corporation.
Data Skeptic isn't so much a corporation,
it's sort of a not very profitable branch of my consulting business.
That's sort of subsidized by other work.
Like I said, passion project. Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be more true to,
let's pick good seasons and put out really good content.
If the numbers drop, my team's gonna let me know,
but I don't want to be thinking about my weekly download numbers as much as I am about
"How do we make a good show?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That makes a lot of sense.
Can you tell me a little bit more
about how this passion project that you started from,
I'm gonna put out an episode a week for as long as I can turn into something that
you can monetize and then how you went about
that initial monetization of your traffic and audience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure.
So the biggest hurdle you have to cross in the podcast world
is having enough listeners that someone wants to work with you.
If you have, you know, 100 listeners,
it just doesn't make sense right for me to cut you a
check for the small amount people would pay for that few downloads.
The broad podcasting ecosystem is a CPM business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I don't know why M is 1000 but cost per 1000 downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's Latin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, well thank you for that. That's a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorry. We also use CPM in advertising.
So I had the same question continue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect, thank you for that. Yeah.
But then if you listen to the majority of podcasts,
they kind of have this,
you hear a lot of like mattress companies and razor companies and
there's sort of a few key industries propping up the industry,
the podcasting advertising industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started there but my audience was big enough and niche enough that
we figured it made more sense to do direct sales.
So now we engage typically with like more of like a
company who will have a longer term ad play with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have four annual sponsors right now
and they'll appear once per month on the show
and think about it from their unit economics,
it's partially a brand play and also the fact that like
one deal close could be a huge thing for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, if you're selling razor blades at a discount price,
you have to go for high volume if you have an enterprise SaaS
tool that companies need and it's a win win for both sides.
A couple of sales is great.
So we figured kind of this platform of how do we get
quality products that we vet to our technical audience so that both sides of
the equation might be happy was really the right place for us to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That makes a lot of sense.
And that brings I guess as to why I'm here talking to you today
is you've recently decided to also start hosting EthicalAds on your site.
Because as a podcast obviously distributed through many sources.
but you do have your own website and you've
started hosting display ads and not just any display ads,
I might add EthicalAds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell me a little bit about that and how that happened?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure
Well, I had seen EthicalAds around on other sites that I liked.
Just kind of technical focus things for developers and data scientist types.
So it was sort of, I felt like I had a pure review in that sense, you know,
I didn't necessarily check with anybody about it,
but I became aware of the brand from being on sites
like that technical stuff and we previously had used Google AdSense.
I don't know how much detail should go into but out
of great frustration with them just abandoned ads on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I thought, you know,
why don't we plug in EthicalAds and see if this will work for us.
So that was a great start for us to resume having some display presence on the site.
And I also like the fact that it has this anonymous qualities,
we're not doing a lot of tracking and this kind
of stuff were just serving what we hope are good
ads that my viewers to our website are actually gonna
potentially like and click on if it's appropriate for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. So I guess I'm kind of curious how you came to the idea of
display advertising for your website independent of EthicalAds.
You said,
you tried Google ads first and it didn't like um work out for you.
Okay. I do want to know about like the the the gritty details if if you'll spare me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure.
Well I guess the problem with AdSense was,
and I don't want to claim like I'm a victim here,
but I think there was sort of a cyber bullying thing going on.
We started getting a high amount of like complaints about like,
oh this is a fraud site, this has adult content,
all these things which just were not true
and there's like this like moderation thing we
could go in and complain about it and then
we were suspended and I just wasn't making
enough money to fight with Google customer service,
which was totally unavailable.
So I just kind of gave up out of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, so kind of like this mega corps
bureaucracy almost, um, just didn't make it a viable option for you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, like we got suspended for no reason and we didn't have an easy recourse.
It just didn't make sense for me to look into it after a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That completely makes sense. It's here to like supplement your income.
and your time is valuable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what has obviously revenue from your mid roll ads
greatly exceeds the display
ad revenue just due to the nature of
podcast distribution, but what has advertising as an industry enabled you to do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perhaps like improve your podcast or your business or how has it
um supported you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the business side,
it's kind of hard to quantify what I call halo opportunities in halo revenue.
A couple of consulting deals a year will materialize out of
people who have been either recent or long time listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's a huge benefit right? To have lead generation that way.
I don't actually even mention on the show that I do
consulting because I'm not necessarily looking to do lead gen,
I'd rather have someone kind of find me or at least be aware, hey,
maybe that's our guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what advertising has really done for us besides that,
that I kind of don't have in a spreadsheet exactly has been able to
generate us a source of revenue that we can reinvest in the podcast itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that as we get more display revenue, we can invest in the site,
more writers, paid writers to come on and do posts for the blog, better content,
better source photos,
all this kind of stuff and hopefully create
a harmonious cycle there And whether it's the
online stuff with EthicalAds or the mid roll ads we have in the podcast,
it's really just been a reinvestment process for us to go from
myself to now a team of four people who are
all compensated for their work contributing to the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That sounds really exciting.
Especially you mentioned some desire to explain and into written content, blog content.
Do you have some kind of vision for the future of
Data Skeptic as like a community hub beyond a podcast?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's something we're carefully thinking about.
We definitely have some launches coming up this year
that will head in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as like being a community where hey,
this is the place to go and learn data science.
We've thought a lot about that.
And I think there are just better places like MOOCs
and courses and things to do that where there's a support
team in place rather than just me and maybe a
few people kind of hanging out in Slack or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I don't know if that's exactly the community we want to build,
but we hope to be a resource for people who
are really getting their hands dirty and data science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you are,
let's say trying to get into some streaming processing
or your first steps in natural language processing,
we're gonna have some solutions available for people
in the future that will make things like that easier
and maybe some opportunities in career development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we're exploring ways that can be harmonious both for
our visitor and however we generate revenue from those sources
and looking into kind of a path like that for
expansion rather than trying to be yet another community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That makes sense.
In a similar vein,
do you have any exciting news that you'd like to share about upcoming episodes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely, if you don't mind? And this one's right on brand
as we've been talking about, we do a season's theme on Data Skeptic.
Earlier this year, we finished up our "time series season".
Then we did K-means clustering for little short while,
which is the famous algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're now finishing up a series.
We call physically distributed all about remote work and the
transition to kind of stay at home type things.
Our new series, which will be out later this year.
Probably about the time this airs or soon to be. In a run for a couple months.
It's called Data Skeptic Ad Tech.
And it's all about the advertising technology that powers the ads we see online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oooh. We have a great difficulty at EthicalAds calling ourselves ad tech because
we are smart about content, not about users.
And ad tech is deeply, deeply ingrained with
some, some sketchy stuff that I'm sure your users will hear about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.
It's like electricity can be used for good and for bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exactly. Is there anything else that you would like to add?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just excited to be on board. The sign up was really easy, appreciated
getting in touch with you guys and looking forward to seeing
what we can develop with EthicalAds in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awesome. We are definitely looking forward to hearing more
about the data science of big ad tech.
I just wanted to say thank you so much for agreeing to this
interview taking the time out of your day to talk with me and answer some questions.
Here's to many more payouts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the major features we released in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In May, we rolled out the ability …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the major features we released in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In May, we rolled out the ability for publishers to show their own fallback house ads
  when we don't have a paid ad to show.
  You can access it on &lt;code&gt;Fallback Ads&lt;/code&gt; menu in your publisher dashboard, if you want to try it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After seeing the success of the small onboarding improvements in our ad server,
  we reworked a number of our standard customer support responses
  to help get new publishers and advertisers on the platform as easily and quickly as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our keyword analyzer is now spidering across the most visited pages in our network.
  This helps us better understand the content where we show ads, curate topics, and show the most relevant ad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We did some initial work on building more targeting and pricing information into our ad server.
  Specifically, having multiple preset regions and topics based on what advertisers frequently buy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the marketing front, we produced a page on how we are
  &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/alternative-to-carbon-ads/?ref=newsletter"&gt;different from other developer ad networks like CarbonAds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest server updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-client changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="may-advertising-stats"&gt;May advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$39,991.85&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers. Just a hair under $40k which we hope to break in the coming months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;125 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;16,183,111&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May was another record breaking month in terms of revenue and it's great to keep the network growing.
Revenue was very consistent over the month and showed the usual ebb and flow of our traffic
with peaks on weekdays and valleys on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we said goodbye to our wonderful account manager and customer success rep Ra
who left us for what sounds like an amazing data science role in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we hand-approve our publishers, we do continuously go back and look at low performers.
In May, we worked with a few low performers to try to improve the ad placements on their site.
While we had some successes here and a large publisher and some small ones were able to bring their
numbers up, a few publishers had to be offboarded from the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're continuing to work on our topic-detection infrastructure.
  We made improvements in May and expect to continue to iterate here in June.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In June, we expect to have a new publisher spotlight post (&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/01/publisher-spotlight-series-ido-shamun-from-dailydev/"&gt;our first with daily.dev&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will also have an updated &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;Q3 prospectus&lt;/a&gt;
  in the next few days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
Please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@ethicalads.io"&gt;email us&lt;/a&gt; if you have any ideas or feedback on our product or roadmap,

&lt;h2 id="seeking-proposals-for-our-community-ads-program"&gt;Seeking proposals for our Community Ads Program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of realizing our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/?ref=community-ads-rfp"&gt;Advertising vision&lt;/a&gt;, we like to give back to the developer community by running &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; ads for open source projects and community initiatives like open source conferences.
This is called our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/community-ads/?ref=community-ads-rfp"&gt;Community Ads Program&lt;/a&gt;.
These ads are for developer serving initiatives that simply don't have the budget for paid advertising.
Historically, we've been proactive about reaching out to causes that we personally attend like regional python conferences, but we'd love to support other initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have an open source project that is entirely free to use that you'd like to share with the world?
Do you run a conference or are starting a local chapter of a developer group that you'd like to advertise?
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/community-ads/?ref=community-ads-rfp"&gt;Let us know&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="previous-community-ads"&gt;Previous Community Ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been running free ads for community events for years now in a variety of languages.
Some examples of ads we've run before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage text-center"&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/pages/community-ads-pycon-example.png" alt="Want to give a talk at Pycon US 2022? Proposals open now until Dec 20th. Apply today!" style="max-width: 300px"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An ad raising awareness for the Call for Proposals for Pycon US 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="postimage text-center"&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2022-pycamp.png" alt="¡Programa tus ideas sin límites durante todo un fin de semana all-inclusive!" style="max-width: 300px"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An ad for a Spanish Python conference, PyCamp 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="postimage text-center"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;An ad for a Bay Area Python conference from 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, these are often ads for regional technical conferences but they don't have to be.
We'd love to run more ads supporting the developer community either by raising awareness for dev-focused charities or non-profit organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

This post will cover …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here at EthicalAds we've been running a book club to help our team grow and learn.
This post will cover a few topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advice on running a lightweight book club&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we're running our book club&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviews of the books we've read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've found this process quite valuable for growing our skills.
Our team is mostly people with a developer background,
so we've been focusing more on business &amp;amp; marketing topics,
since that's where we all have a lot to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="book-club-goals-advice"&gt;Book club goals &amp;amp; advice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've read 4 books in our book club so far,
and we have learned a few tips and tricks for making sure it feels valuable to everyone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't overthink what is required to get started. We didn't have a concrete outcome when we started, and are still learning as we go. Just get started!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you pick a book, have an actionable task that we want to be able to solve once we read the book.
    - As an example, our next book is around writing better email. Our goal is to improve our default email replies for publishers &amp;amp; advertisers in our support tooling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the topics of the book each time, so that you're getting a well-rounded set of topics that affect your business.
    - We've covered open source, positioning, copywriting, and marketing thus far.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you're producing something when you read the book, otherwise it can feel like you're reading a lot of theory, but not putting that knowledge to work.
    - You'll also retain the information more if you're forced to use it, rather than just read it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-to-run-a-book-club"&gt;How to run a book club&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our book club is pretty lightweight.
It looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a recurring weekly meeting for 30 minutes, to handle whatever needs to be discussed that week, generally what we've read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the reading, each member of the team takes notes around what they thought was interesting or actionable for our company, and we mostly discuss this in our 30 meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We usually aim for around 30-60 minutes of reading, to keep the time commitment manageable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we want to decide which book to read, we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss what we want to get out of the book, and which topic to focus on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then each member of the team looks for a book that they think would fit well (3 total).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We discuss each book, and decide as a team which one to read (if there isn't an obvious choice, we just flip a digital coin).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We discuss a basic plan for an area of the business to improve after reading the book, so we have an actionable goal at the end of the book to put the information to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We start reading!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's likely improvements we'll keep making as we go,
but this is enough for us to get a lot of value from book club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="book-reviews"&gt;Book reviews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are reviews of the books that we've already read,
presented in the order we read them.
If you're looking for some ideas for what to read,
this might be a good place to start!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal with this book was to better understand the publishers of our platform,
many of which are open source projects.
We are also an open source project ourselves,
so that was another avenue that we also wanted to read more about.
The book is a high-level overview of how open source works,
and is a wonderful categorization of the various types of open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who has done a lot of open source work,
I found Nadia wonderfully put words to a lot of concepts I understood but couldn't explain.
If you have a business need or personal curiosity to understand how open source functions,
this book is a wonderful "Getting Started" guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="building-a-brand-story-clarify-your-message-so-customers-will-listen-donald-miller"&gt;&lt;a href="https://buildingastorybrand.com/"&gt;Building a Brand Story: Clarify Your Message So Customers Will Listen - Donald Miller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Story Brand framework, a hero (customer) has a problem, meets a guide
who gives them a plan to solve the problem and succeed.
As a business, our job is to position ourselves as the guide
helping the customer to succeed.
The core message of the brand story is to put the customer first.
This applies to all aspects of a business but especially (for a business like ours)
on our website and in our email communication
This is the key to having customers read and engage with our business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few consequences of the Story Brand framework. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The customer is the hero of the story. Not the brand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messaging needs to be simple and straight-forward. Our website is akin to an elevator pitch. Offers should be direct and above the fold. Sometimes less is more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the customer a plan for how our business helps them succeed. The solution by itself isn't a plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the hero has succeeded, affirm their success and tell stories of heroes who have succeeded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-growth-marketing-handbook-julian-shapiro"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/intro"&gt;The Growth Marketing Handbook - Julian Shapiro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to prioritize the actionable, our EthicalAds book club tacked Julian Shapiro’s blog “The Growth Marketing Handbook” as our second group project. Touching on everything from designing and A/B testing landing pages to user acquisition channels and onboarding, the handbook certainly tries to cover it all. While we figured out our brand’s story and thus strategy pretty thoroughly in our first book club book, we took reading this handbook’s sections on webpages as a guide for revamping our user’s experience on our own site. Unfortunately, the “making ads” section wasn’t very insightful as it largely reiterated the lessons learned in landing page design such as an emphasis on concision and clarity with regards to the benefits of your product for your user. The section on “running ads” was particularly interesting to us as it was almost entirely focused on optimizations for tracker-based advertising and how to optimize retargeted ads for conversions differently. While we have no plans to ever run ads on surveillance adtech platforms, the section did illuminate some key differentiators for us to highlight when comparing our service to that of our competitors. All in all, strategy was covered pretty thoroughly in our first book but “The Growth Marketing Handbook” is definitely worth a read for the website optimization guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-copywriters-handbook-a-step-by-step-guide-to-writing-copy-that-sells-robert-bly"&gt;&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250238016/thecopywritershandbook"&gt;The Copywriter's Handbook: A Step-By-Step Guide To Writing Copy That Sells - Robert Bly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book was divided into two major sections, one that gives a theoretical foundation around copywriting, and one that applies that knowledge to specific fields (eg. Writing Online Ads or Writing Direct Mail). Our team read the book without the goal of becoming copywriters, but learning more about copywriting in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meant we found the higher level theoretical information quite useful, giving concrete advice for the value and craft of writing great copy that sells. The individual sections on specific types of copywriting were more of a high-level reference for that specific type of copywriting, and we didn't find much value in these sections. In fact, we only read 1/2 of the later sections of the book, focusing on areas where we thought would be most applicable. However, given the nature of the writing as a high-level reference, we didn't get as much value out of the sections that we already knew a lot about. I would recommend reading the topic-specific sections if there is an area you would find value in an overview of, instead of deeper insight into a specific area you already know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the major features we released in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our server, we've begun implementing server-side keywords analysis! This will let us swap out our algorithms easier for better topic-detection in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've also started crafting custom advertiser keyword dashboards in &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/12/graphing-ad-data-at-ethicalads/?ref=april-newsletter"&gt;metabase&lt;/a&gt; to give our recurring clients more insight into which keywords affect CTR the most.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our publisher dashboard, we've launched a new publisher onboarding checklist to make getting approved for paid ads easier than ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're also debuting a similar advertiser onboarding page in our dashboard for new advertisers, outlining the steps to kick-off their campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest server updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-client changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="april-advertising-stats"&gt;April advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$38,967.84&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;124 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;16,246,064&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April was another record breaking month in terms of revenue!
Our daily revenue peaked at almost $2500 and not a single day saw less than $1000 in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We succeeded in selling all of our traffic in high-demand topics and regions in April, leading to the aforementioned revenue record!
Thus, we've been brainstorming new methods of getting the word out to new publishers such as revamping our landing pages and producing quality original content.
Expanding our network by onboarding new publishers is now our top priority so we can continue to meet advertiser demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworking our topic-detection infrastructure and algorithm in our server (in progress!!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building more information about pricing into our ad server, so we can work towards automated self-serve re-up campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

While scrolling through your feed of …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When was the last time you clicked on an ad while browsing social media?
While scrolling through your feed of friends and family, ads for random gadgets or cheesy games annoy many, but why?
The ad itself is undoubtedly tailored to your own personal interests or brands that you like. So why is it irritating?
Because you as a user, had no intention of shopping. Your purpose in logging on was to socialize, not to shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="intent-is-irreplacable"&gt;Intent is irreplacable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search ads have been the dominant form of display ad since they were invented over 20 years ago and to no wonder.
If a user is actively searching for a flower store, there is already an intent to purchase flowers present which motivated this search.
The same can be true of software products and solutions. If a developer is using a search engine to find a cloud hosting service,
chances are good that they intend to utilize a cloud hosting service in the near future.
&lt;strong&gt;User Intent&lt;/strong&gt; is the &lt;a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/guide-user-intent/"&gt;greatest individual factor&lt;/a&gt; to convert a potential candidate into a paying customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But search engines are not the only places where software developers exhibit their intent.
From using online tools like &lt;a href="https://jsbin.com"&gt;jsbin.com&lt;/a&gt; rendering their html edits in real-time to scouring package documentation to fix their latest bug,
software developers telegraph their intentions primarily through the content that they are viewing.
This can be numerically demonstrated in the comparison of Click through rates (CTR) on content-targeted campaigns vs non-content targeted campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-our-data-says"&gt;What our data says&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we'll examine the average weekly CTR across all of our advertising flights that are targeting geographic locations only.
If we had no campaigns ending that week, it's been logged as a 0.
As you can see, almost every week our geo-only campaigns fall below our network average CTR of 0.1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage text-center"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-75 shadow-lg" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2022-no-keywords-ctr.png" alt="A screenshot of the Click through Rates for untargeted campaigns"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the average weekly CTR for untargeted campaigns in Q3 and Q4 of 2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do our content-targeted campaigns fare? Using the same weekly aggregation, it's evident that our content-targeted campaigns frequently exceed our network's average CTR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage text-center"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-75 shadow-lg" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2022-keywords-ctr.png" alt="A screenshot of the Click through Rates for content-targeted campaigns"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the average weekly CTR for content-targeted campaigns in Q3 and Q4 of 2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our CTR (click through rate) is consistently higher on campaigns which employ content-targeting in addition to geographic targeting.
Which leads one to wonder, given that geography is a factor of the user whereas content is a factor of the publishing website,
why has so much of ad-tech been focusing on user-targeting and &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/surveillance-advertising/?ref=content-as-intent"&gt;surveillance advertising&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to content-targeting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-return-of-content-targeting"&gt;The Return of Content Targeting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content Targeting is by no means a new invention. It's been around for as long as niche publications have existed.
Fishing pole ads in fishing magazines and motor oil ads in car magazines have existed for decades.
However, in the last 15 years, the ad-tech industry largly swapped over to user-targeting under the misguided notion that intent doesn't expire.
Buy 1 dvd player online and you'll continue to get dvd players showing up in ads for months although the problem that these ads are trying to fix is already solved.
So how did we get here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One marketing company Invoca said on &lt;a href="https://www.invoca.com/blog/tracking-cookies-are-dead-what-marketers-can-do-about-it"&gt;the topic&lt;/a&gt;,
“For years, marketers have been addicted to using third-party data,
but it wasn’t because third-party data was the most effective way to reach their target customers.
Actually, it was because that data was just so easy for them to access and execute short-term campaigns."
And we're inclined to agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been operating the EthicalAds network for almost 2 years now and have achieved our highest revenue month to date just last month in March,
all without ever using any user tracking.
By matching developers with ads relevant to their interests, here and today, based on what they're currently reading
we can garauntee our advertisers connect not only with the right &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/our-audience/?ref=content-as-intent"&gt;software developer audience&lt;/a&gt;,
but more importantly, reach those valuable potential customers right when they're grappling the problem that you're trying to solve.
When developers posses a problem, they use the EthicalAds network to find answers and thus posses the intent to try your solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="would-you-like-to-learn-more"&gt;Would you like to learn more?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Updated our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/privacy-policy/?ref=newsletter"&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt; to explicitly mention our usage of 3rd party analytics platform, Plausible.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$31,749.65&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;118 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;14,605,352&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March continued to pick up steam and resulted in even more revenue for our publishers.
We also expanded our network adding 10 more publishers in March alone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're on track to be sold out in North America and Europe by the end of April!
This is great news for our publishers as it means we're able to pay them more money for their traffic.
Our attention now turns back to acquiring more publishers and expanding our network to accomodate all of our advertisers' campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Optimized our aggregation algorithms to keep us informed regarding our network and traffic more rapidly than ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made a number of performance optimizations to keep our ads serving as fast as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We rolled out a change to use Cloudflare's geolocation in our ad targeting. This seemed a better way to keep up-to-date and also to avoid billing for ads where the geolocation can't be determined (eg. Tor).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$$31,060.46&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;15,283,991&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being 10% shorter than January, our revenue increased by 1.67% in February!
This puts us  on track for a great March.
Our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/sponsorship-platform/?ref=jan-newsletter"&gt;Sponsorship Management Platform&lt;/a&gt; Beta also
once again served over &lt;strong&gt;2,500,000&lt;/strong&gt; sponsored logo placements in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still slightly undersold in February but making gains everyday.
March is on track to beat February but in order to really set us over the top,
we're trying to close more globally targetted campaigns.
The EthicalAds audience extends all around the globe!
Getting new and exciting tools in front of developers that actually help them solve problems
they're working on right now, is always exciting.
Filling our global traffic with good offers is where we have the most room to grow in this capacity of serving our community.&lt;/p&gt;

that enabled users to quickly and easily add a floating ad placement
to their site without having to write custom code.
Today, we're announcing this feature is available to any publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="floating-placements-perform"&gt;Floating placements perform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new placement has been running about 10% of Read the Docs' ad traffic
and all of the traffic on Read the Docs' &lt;a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;own documentation&lt;/a&gt;.
So far, the data has been very promising with ads leading to clickthroughs 31% more than our normal placement.
Having ads that work without resorting to either personalized tracking
or being intrusive is our core mission.
Better performing ads result in happier advertisers and more money in independent publishers' pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="usage"&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature is available to any publisher who wants to use it
by setting the &lt;code&gt;data-ea-style="stickybox"&lt;/code&gt; attribute on their ad placement.
For very wide screens, this will cause the advertisement to be in a dismissable
box in the lower right corner (this can be styled with CSS).
For screens below ultra wide, the ad will be a standard inline ad placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of publishers had requested this feature or had built it themselves
for their own site and we wanted to have a base implementation available for all our publishers.
See our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#stickybox"&gt;full documentation&lt;/a&gt; on the feature for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are features you're interested to see in our ad client,

&lt;p&gt;These are the major features we released in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the ad server, we've added tighter Stripe integrations for our advertisers to view
  previous invoices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also revamped our keyword aggregation algorithms to run much faster and more reliably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A publisher's view rate is now displayed in their publisher portal as a key indicator of their placement quality. View rate is the number of times an ad is viewed, which is higher when it's more visible on the page. It will likely never be 100%, since some users will close the browser after requesting an ad, but before it is displayed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgraded to Python 3.8 along with many other small bug fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest server updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-client changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="january-advertising-stats"&gt;January advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$30,543.39&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;110 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;13,326,966&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our holiday slump mildly carried over into January
resulting in 2% less paid views and 4% less ad revenue.
On the plus side, our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/sponsorship-platform/?ref=jan-newsletter"&gt;Sponsorship Management Platform&lt;/a&gt; Beta
served over &lt;strong&gt;2,700,000&lt;/strong&gt; sponsored logo placements in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time in 6 months, our current largest hurdle to growth
is expanding our advertisers and their campaigns.
We have available ad inventory across all regions.
This is partly an aftershock of advertisers taking a break during the holidays
and amplified by the fact that some of our larger advertisers
manually split their campaigns between domains on the EthicalAds network.
Thus, some of our sites have consistently high Fill Rates (&amp;gt;80%) whereas
others flunctuate wildly between 40-90% based on the amount of daily traffic.
We're happy to report that we're starting several new campaigns in February.
Thus February is already on track to beat January
in terms of both views and publisher revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworking our topic-detection infrastructure and algorithm in our server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New graphics summarizing the volume of views and popular topics across our network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rolling out the floating ad placement to more domains on Read the Docs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

December was a shorter month for us at EthicalAds so this update will be short and sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the major features we released in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debuted the beta for our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/sponsorship-platform/"&gt;sponsorship platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Released our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;advertising prospectus&lt;/a&gt; for 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest server updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-client changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="december-advertising-stats"&gt;December advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$31,782.17&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;102 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;13,654,617&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, our views did decrease precipitously during the holidays (down around 40% from November),
but our revenue only decreased by 8% over the same time.
This was due mostly to some large, inexpensive campaigns wrapping up
in addition to launching some highly targeted campaigns with a higher avergae CPM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onboarding new publishers remains our largest hurdle to growth.
We're attempting to combat this by creating and sharing interesting new content,
like our first &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2022/01/publisher-spotlight-series-ido-shamun-from-dailydev/"&gt;publisher interview&lt;/a&gt; with the creator of daily.dev Ido Shamun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not many items on our roadmap were changed in the December flurry but
we are conducting exciting research into incorporating more complex natural language processing methods as a part of our decision engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved keyword extraction occuring in the ad server as opposed to the ad client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More intuitive graphs in the ad server for advertisers and publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding view time reporting to ensure high quality views are counted as such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part of a new publisher spotlight series where we highlight publishers
using EthicalAds and help them tell their story.
This first episode is with Ido Shamun from &lt;a href="https://daily.dev"&gt;Daily.dev&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David: Hello and and welcome to sort of the first episode of an EthicalAds podcast.
I'd like to introduce my guest who is Ido Shamun, one of the founders of Daily.dev,
which aims to be every developers homepage. Welcome Ido.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ido: Hey David, it's great to be here. Good luck with your new series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks. It might be a very short series, but we'll see how it goes.
So firstly I'd love to get in your words, what is Daily.dev?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Daily.dev is a platform for developers.
We aggregate news, developer news from all over the web. Hundreds of sources.
We personalize it for the developers so they get only the content they are interested in.
We've been running this product for like three years already,
four years and it's growing growing pretty great so far.
Um, we've reached 100,000 weekly active users,
almost 60,000 users every day. So it's going pretty good. I would say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's a lot of daily actives.
Yeah, it sounds, it sounds like it's going really well. How'd you get started?
What made you get started on this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we started as a side project honestly.
We started it as out of a need that we
had in our engineering team back in our previous company.
So we had like, we had this slack bot that kept sending us notifications,
on new content from different sources.
And we thought, maybe we can build something out of it and create something for
other developers so they will be able to enjoy it as well.
So we started slowly releasing the first version,
someone entered us on ProductHunt slowly the
world of mouth increased and at some point,
we decided to go full on on this project and we founded the company and now
we've been growing the team as well, so yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's fantastic. That sounds like everything's going really well.
What sort of tech stack are you looking at with with Daily.dev?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So mainly we look at NodeJS, Javascript, React
for the front end and we have several,
services written in Golang and Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really depends on the task at hand. Python is very great at
scraping and Golang for performance, critical missions,
but mostly JavaScript is our go to language&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sure, that's cool.
The developer homepage has been sort of like the
goal of a lot of products in the past,
Maybe google reader, but definitely iGoogle. I remember that service.
I was a user of iGoogle which was sort of like a
developer homepage gave you some features like that.
Maybe even Reddit.
Reddit could be considered the homepage for for people.
What sets Daily.dev apart from these other things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first of all,
I think the fact that we are aiming only for developers really enables
us uh to fit our solution to the audience to the community.
Because if we wanted, for example to aggregate news
for the general audience,
then the product would probably end up being something totally different.
So the fact that we're doing it for developers gives us,
a better a very chance to succeed in our mission.
We also choose some unique way to implement this vision,
which is a browser extension.
So we we have both a browser extension and a web app that we built later on,
but we started as a browser extension that overrides your new tab.
So we are actually on page once you install us.
So every time you open a new tab, you see the news for developers like you.
You can choose and get whatever you want out of it.
And maybe even comment or up-vote the
articles you love and contact with other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's really cool.
By occupying the new tab space, I feel like every developer has got like 50 tabs and sometimes you close them,
you declare tab bankruptcy and go back to go back to square zero for the next day.
Some people, some people don't declare bankruptcy for a couple weeks.
By doing that, you must be doing like a ton of traffic,
You talked a little bit about your daily
actives and your monthly actives or weekly actives.
What kind of total traffic are you doing even excluding duplicates?
So, you know, not just users, but like total traffic. You must be doing a ton.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, a total traffic in around 30 million page views per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's a lot.
I think going back to sort of like my work and Read the Docs,
that's probably about where Read the Docs is
and Read the Docs is massive and hosts tons of projects.
So you're you're handling an absolute ton of traffic. That's really cool.
II also think it's interesting that
you talked about focusing really on developers.
You know, that that's sort of something that we at EthicalAds.
That that's exactly what we're doing, right.
You know, we're not super innovative in those terms.
We're just another ad network,
but by really focusing on developers and the
goals of developers and what developers want.
I think that
there's almost always a niche you can carve out for yourself. So that's really cool.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And today developers are not that niche even.
It's a very big community in a very big audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, true, true. Yeah.
This is going to be the simple question: how does Daily.dev make money?
How do you how do you monetize your traffic and audience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So obviously we we run ads. This is exactly the reason we're doing this interview.
But for us we knew from the first moment that this product should be free.
We don't like the paywall thing of content,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have to figure out a different way
to make money and make this project sustainable.
So we saw advertisements as a potential monetization channel,
which for now works great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, that's that's really cool.
You know, Read the Docs had a similar issue with sustainability early in our history,
and ads really made sense for us as well.
It sort of grows as your audience grows,
typically as your audience is growing your server costs
are growing and all sorts of things are growing.
So having something that that scales with that is good rather than
things that don't like user donations sometimes
don't scale with the size of the project.
Sometimes they do, sometimes they scale in weird ways.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, one of the interesting questions and part of the reason
why I think it's really interesting to talk to you
from like the EthicalAds business perspective is you show
a mix of EthicalAds and ads from Carbon,
another developer focused ad network.
Why did you go that route instead of sticking with a single ad network?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the same reason as a network
looks for many publishers and many advertisers you don't want
to be locked to one single network,
that can theoretically do whatever they want with you, right?
Because I'm tied, I'm bound to this one network.
Now if if the prices go up, I have nothing to do with it.
If something bad happens and suddenly there have no advertisers there,
again in this situation I can't do anything.
Where if I try to work with several networks, then I reduce my risk as a business
and get a more stable monetization channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also for some clients do direct deals if they ask us for something very custom.
So for Daily.dev, we actually have three ways to to sell ads.
So it's through Carbon, through Ethical and through direct deals.
We also believe that, you know, competition is very good for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, good.
We are happy to compete with Carbon as far as we compete.
We're both sort of tiny when you compare us with say something like Google.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now in the past you used CodeFund.
Do you want to talk a little bit about that?
What happened to CodeFund?
I think Eric Barry who was sort of the founder of Code Fund, he probably talked to you a lot,
I talked to Eric a lot too. How did you like working with CodeFund?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Berry is still a very good friend even though you know we went our
separate ways in some way after he had to close CodeFund.
But I think CodeFund is also some of the reason we are doing this mix [with Carbon and EthicalAds] after
we experienced the shutdown of the network that we work with,
we saw the impact on our revenue, so we knew we had to tackle it in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the experience with CodeFund was pretty great,
The people behind it and what they did was truly amazing.
Unfortunately things have turned out the way they turned,
but for us it was a real joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah.
Eric Berry was fantastic when he was working on CodeFund.
I mean, he's still fantastic today.
I still talk to Eric from time to time. I count him as a friend.
The privacy preserving ad space
is pretty small and it was sad for Eric to leave that space.
But at the same time, very good for us as that sort of helped us launch our network.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notably you don't have Google ads in the mix,
Were you just are you just happy enough with the existing mix of two
or three if you count your own direct sales or was there a particular reason you didn't want Google ads?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually there was a particular reason we don't want advertisements that
don't have to do anything with developers to be on our feed.
For example, I don't want to see Nike shoes on our feed.
Not that I have anything against Nike shoes, but it's just not a tool for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want our community members to feel feel at home and don't feel someone is trying to sell to them.
Whenever I get a chance to talk to someone who uses this Daily.dev,
they always mention that they don't even know that it's ads on there.
It's very native to their experience.
You obviously know because you sell the ads,
but you can see tools like MongoDB, Slack, CircleCI all of those companies and services that developers look for.
Whereas in GoogleAds,
you can get something based on your recent Google search,
so it really doesn't fit our audience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, I completely understand. That's that's feedback that we do get.
You're not the first person to give me that feedback.
In fact on Read the Docs, we thought something similar.
We didn't want to show ads based on your past Google
searches or based on retargeted traffic or something like that,
even though as somebody who sort of sells advertising for a living,
I know that those work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know that those work decently well for advertisers, but it can sort of take you out of the moment.
If you're reading a very tech heavy site or something like that and then suddenly you get an ad
for Nike shoes because you bought shoes a week ago that can sort of take you out of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, we also prefer --
so someone coined the term context aware ads --
I think where we put the the ad based on the content you see,
not necessarily the content you read [previously].
So, although right now we are doing kind of a mix between the two,
we want to we want to slowly shift to context aware,
which has obviously less tracking and less everything that has to
do with privacy.
If you read a web development article,
all I have to do is target based on the article which is about web development,
I don't need to know anything about you,
which immediately removes all the privacy concerns out of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You're basically pitching my business,
This is fantastic.
That's sort of one of the things that we really
specialize in is having really targeting ads to content.
Obviously we still have some big advertisers who buy everything developer related.
But we have advertisers who just want to buy
maybe back end web development or advertisers who just
want to buy Blockchain or advertisers who just want
to buy like data science or something like that.
We definitely believe in sort of like context targeted ads
over behavioral targeted or past action targeted ads.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's interesting to hear you talk about that because normally
that's sort of like on the ad networks problem.
But I guess if you're selling your own ads some of the time that that becomes [your problem].
You're going to have advertisers say, "hey, I want to buy Daily.dev,
but just this niche, not all developers".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a general purpose tool for developers.
It's not like we are a data science tool.
If we were a data science tool or part of the data science community,
I want to show only data science ads.
In our case, every user has different preferences and
is looking for something different.
So although you own the network and you sell the ads,
I still need to be able to indicate to you as a network what kind of
ad I need in this case because we are more flexible than just the usual [publisher].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah.
You are you you definitely delve a little deeper
into that than than most of our publishers.
That's for sure.
But that's also what makes it kind of interesting to talk to you about this.
So that that's really cool.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you had an advertiser reach out to you and ask you specifically "I want this niche".
Is that a common occurrence or has that happened a few times or tell me about that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially the case when they reach out to us out for direct deals.
Otherwise we direct them to you or to Carbon depending on the customer,
because closing a direct deal for us is a lot of overhead.
So sometimes we prefer to pay the rev share and just
direct the client to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sure. I understand.
It does come down to it.
When you're building a site right?
If you can handle that relationship efficiently yourself,
handle your own sponsorships or your own deals,
you're gonna make more money than you would
with handing it off to ads, but it also is a distraction.
So it is sort of a trade off.
I think there is sort of a threshold sometimes where sites get big enough,
where they're big enough to handle some of their own deals.
That's probably about where you are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some sites are just too small for that.
There's just no way that they could handle the overhead of a deal like that.
That's interesting.
You're sort of talking exactly to sort of like the life cycle.
As publishers get big.
Once the publisher is enormous,
they don't need somebody like us or even somebody like Carbon.
Yeah, there's definitely sort of a mix in this size.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the journey is still very long until we just this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sure. Us too.
What has the revenue from advertising sort of enabled you to do for Daily.dev?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It enabled us to go full on on this project without
risking our personal life in a way because we were able to get a decent salary
at the time we started.
It enables us now to hire new team
members and to be able to build the product much faster.
You touched it at first, but having the ads really enables us to focus on growth
rather than monetization because it grows end by end.
So if you grow the community,
the monetization channels will grow as well and we don't have to think about churn
and conversion rates and stuff like this.
We can really focus on delivering great value to the users and just increase the awareness to the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cool. Yeah, that's fantastic.
What are some new features that are coming for Daily.dev?
If you could talk about them? I don't want spoilers if you don't want to spoil it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're pretty open about the things we build and we have also the change log
that we keep pumping with news like almost every week.
So this is obviously a great place to check if you want to see what we released before.
But anyway, what's upcoming next is we are planning a revamp of our layout.
The grid will remain the same,
but you will see a new sidebar with tons of new options for navigation and quick links and everything you need.
So the user interface is going to change pretty drastically.
And we're also looking for ways to
increase the communication between different users.
We're thinking about letting the community publish their own [content].
by submitting like HackerNews or connecting with each others in a way of two.
So 2022 will probably be around community and networking with other developers on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's awesome.
Hopefully 2022 is a big year.
It's coming up. Every time I say that I sort of scare myself a little bit.
I know it's like just two weeks away&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I guess we're recording this in December,
although it probably won't go live until January, just a meta discussion,
breaking down that third wall.
Before I let you go,
is there is there anything else you want to add,
anything about EthicalAds, anything not add related. Really anything.
Do you want to give a shout out to anybody?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at everything that's going on right now with the developers landscape,
this is a great time to be a developer.
Everyone is interested in developer tools and making the life of developers
much easier and simpler.
I really appreciate the fact that
I have the chance to serve such a great community and I hope I will
keep doing it for the upcoming years and
I'm so grateful to have great partners like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you very much. You know, I totally agree with you.
It's a great time to build a product.
That that's exactly what we're doing. That's exactly what you're doing.
It's fantastic.
It's probably the best time in history to create something new.
So you know that it's a great time to be alive I suppose.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it's super easy to create products this day.
You almost need to think only about business logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. With all the services out there.
Basically every time I think about Stripe, I'm like, "oh man Stripe's magical".
How could I run a business without Stripe.
There's a Stripe for everything though
like there's a different product for
whatever it is, whatever it is you need to do.
There's something to help you build that.
So yeah, it's truly a great time to be a developer.
It's such like a great positive outlook. I love it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks a lot Ido for for doing this interview and taking the
time out of your day to talk with me
and answer these questions and everything like that.
I really appreciate it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you David.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="publisher-spotlight"></category></entry><entry><title>EthicalAds Newsletter - November 2021</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/12/ethicalads-newsletter-november-2021/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-12-10T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-12-10T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ra Cohen</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2021-12-10:/blog/2021/12/ethicalads-newsletter-november-2021/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last month we were able to get the whole ads team together for our first ever in-person EthicalAds meetup!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the major features we released in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rolled out our new &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#placement-style"&gt;floating ad&lt;/a&gt; type for all publishers as well as implemented its usage on Read the Docs' &lt;a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;own documentation&lt;/a&gt;. This is an opt-in feature that publishers can choose if they want a floating ad in the corner which is a pretty common setup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a stripe integration so advertisers can view previous invoices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarified flight completion/budget remaining progress bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made some infrastructure improvements to better manage our load and isolate reporting from our live transactional data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest server updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-client changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="november-advertising-stats"&gt;November advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$34,679.11&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;102 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;19,103,581&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that November has a US holiday in it,
we expected a drop in revenue and views.
Imagine our surprise to see that our revenue actually increased in November by just over 8%!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holidays tend to slow down traffic and thus ad views/revenue across the world.
We are expecting a decrease in our key performance metrics as the year wraps up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved graphs in the ad server for advertisers and publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding view time reporting to ensure high quality views are counted as such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved keyword detection in the ad client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.

While we don't track or store personal data at EthicalAds,
running an ad network does generate a ton of data!
This is data like the publishers where certain ads perform best
or the best time of day or region to run certain ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the data was a bit hard to explore,
let alone creating and telling a compelling story from the data.
It was tied up in PostgreSQL and usually required complex joins
to get at anything meaningful.
We knew the data we were collecting could help us understand and improve our product,
but exploring our data, understanding it,
and presenting it to our advertisers, publishers, or even just ourselves was hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="business-intelligence-more-than-just-an-oxymoron"&gt;Business intelligence - more than just an oxymoron&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew we needed a tool to bridge the gap between what we had and what we wanted to know.
Ideally, it could help us with exploration, tracking our key performance indicators,
and presenting data to our advertisers, publishers, and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gave &lt;a href="https://www.metabase.com/?ref=ethicalads.io"&gt;Metabase&lt;/a&gt; a try
on a glowing recommendation from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/coderberry"&gt;Eric Berry&lt;/a&gt;,
who previously founded CodeFund, another company dedicated to ethical advertising.
Eric raved about Metabase and used it in CodeFund's product before it shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe as developers we have an implicit bias against data analysis and BI tools
or maybe it's just me and I hadn't found one I liked.
However, after trying Metabase, I was hooked.
You could explore data with or without SQL, share graphs with coworkers,
and there was an easy and secure way to embed them into our product.
Lastly, this never impacts production since our setup exclusively connects to a read-replica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage text-center"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-75" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2021-dashboard-screenshot-graphs.png" alt="A screenshot of the EthicalAds dashboard with an embedded Metabase graph"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The EthicalAds dashboard with an embedded Metabase graph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In about a week, we went from no data stack at all,
to taking visualizations from the exploration stage right into production.
It was easy to explore our data and there was a nice way to embed
graphs and charts directly into our ad server for advertisers and publishers.
It also became an invaluable way to track our business KPIs.
Metabase is the perfect tool for a small team like ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="data-we-have-yet-to-explore"&gt;Data we have yet to explore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months back, we started collecting data on how long an ad is on the screen (we call it "view time").
We think this is a really valuable metric in understanding what leads to clickthroughs
and we think that advertisers will really like it.
Advertisers routinely tell us they love all the data we share with them
and that other networks are far less transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple months, we'll be diving into this and other data.
Hopefully we'll have some great insights to share.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="graphing"></category><category term="business"></category><category term="kpis"></category></entry><entry><title>EthicalAds providing free analytics with Simple Analytics</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/11/ethicalads-providing-free-analytics-with-simple-analytics/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-11-30T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-11-30T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Eric Holscher</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2021-11-30:/blog/2021/11/ethicalads-providing-free-analytics-with-simple-analytics/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;EthicalAds is excited to be a part of the privacy-first ecosystem.

We provide our publishers a revenue stream without compromising the privacy of their users,
and we love supporting those sites moving away from any kind of tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today we're proud to announce that we've partnered with another privacy-first company,
&lt;a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/?ref=ethicalads-blog"&gt;Simple Analytics&lt;/a&gt;,
to enable you to have free privacy-first analytics on your site.&lt;/strong&gt;
They are a great alternative to Google Analytics,
and pair well with &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/alternative-to-google-ads/"&gt;EthicalAds as an alternative to Google Ads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-simple-analytics"&gt;What is Simple Analytics?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/?ref=ethicalads-blog"&gt;Simple Analytics&lt;/a&gt; is a privacy-first analytics product.
They provide similar promises to EthicalAds in terms of privacy,
and have a similar audience of developer-focused sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting from &lt;a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/our-promise"&gt;Simple Analytics' Our Promise&lt;/a&gt; page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will never collect personal information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will never sell your data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No tracking pixels on our platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because they don't sell your data,
they have to charge money to make the business work.
We thought it was a shame that price would be a barrier to making the web more private,
so we came up with a partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="funding-the-privacy-first-web"&gt;Funding the privacy-first web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking more deeply about our two different businesses,
it seems like we could benefit each other in different ways.
EthicalAds is about generating revenue for publishers, and Simple Analytics is a service those exact same publishers are likely buying.
There are some pretty interesting ways to combine that when you focus on the actual sites using both of our tools.
It really made us start thinking of ways that we could use EthicalAds to power the privacy-first revolution of website publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple Analytics wasn't able to offer a free plan.
Having a 14-day free trial allows users to try it,
but we're excited about being able to offer a permanent free tier for developer-focused sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-offer"&gt;The offer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Simple Account normally costs $19 a month for 100k page views and $59 for 1 million page views.
In this joint offer,
we would like to give away a free Simple Analytics account for everybody that starts publishing on EthicalAds.
You can also apply if you already have a Simple Analytics subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started apply to be a publisher and mention Simple Analytics in your email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publishers/#inbound-form" class="btn btn-primary lift mr-0 mr-sm-5 mb-2" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="200"&gt;
  Apply to be a publisher
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offer Terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a developer-focused site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have at least 20,000 paid ad views per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You agree with our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publisher-policy/"&gt;Publisher Policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This deal is valid until December 31st, 2021, but we will continue to pay for Simple Analytics as long as you are a publisher on EthicalAds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you sign up through this deal,
EthicalAds will share your email with Simple Analytics so they can open a free account for you.
When you don't publish anymore EthicalAds will signal Simple Analytics and your plan will convert to a paid account from that moment on.
Simple Analytics will send you a message before they convert your account to paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$32,097.44&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;102 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;19,714,391&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's really exciting about October is that although we only had
a 2.5% increase in the number of paid views from September,
in October we saw a 7.5% increase in our paid clicks!
Just over &lt;strong&gt;24,000&lt;/strong&gt; paid ads were clicked in October
As we grow, we can be more selective with our advertisers,
ensuring users on the EthicalAds network see only high quality, relevant ads
that you might actually be interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue expanding our network by onboarding new publishers.
To accomplish this, we're focusing on raising the eCPM in a variety of ways.
Firstly we raised the prices this quarter on our highest demand traffic.
Secondly, we're phasing out CPC or Cost Per Click pricing.
This ensures our publishers get paid for their views and
incentivizes our advertisers to craft high performing, attractive ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see our progress by observing the increase of our publisher payouts over time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When growing an online business, it's important to consider
where your prospects are coming from and how to convert these prospects into customers.
One key insight into this conversion comes from observing how your users interact with your site.
Without some understanding of why people click on your page, what they do while they're there,
and how this behavior corresponds to paying customers,
you're at a serious disadvantage when it comes to optimizing your site to grow your business.
Part of this process is building marketing funnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A marketing funnel is a continuous mission of getting, keeping, and growing your customer base
while using technology to meet their needs more efficiently.
However, many implementations of marketing funnels execute this mission
by collecting and hoarding personally identifiable information of individual customers.
This is by no means required by the definition nor is it even necessary
as marketing funnels have existed long before web browser trackers let alone the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="our-specific-business"&gt;Our specific business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EthicalAds is a small start-up currently focusing on expanding our userbase which comes in two segments.
We have potential advertisers who want to run new ad campaigns on our ad network and
we have potential publishers who want to host ads on their websites/platforms
in exchange for a lionshare of the generated ad revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to attract new users, we've created a number of advertiser/publisher focused ads
and advertiser/publisher specific landing pages augmenting our general referral sources
like search engines or the "Ad served Ethically" text which runs beneath every ad.
However, we previously had no good way of determining the relative success of these various approaches.
In order to prioritize our time on new ads, landing pages, or other marketing strategies,
we wanted data to guide our decision making to help us meet the needs of our customers efficiently.
In other words, we needed a marketing funnel.
Specifically, we wanted our marketing funnel to be privacy-preserving, open-source, and transparent.
In a word, Ethical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started we needed two things,  a measurement of a successful conversion and
a way to quantify which marketing methods were leading to the most conversions
while maintaining our must-haves of everything being open-source and not-personally identifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage px-md-10"&gt;
 &lt;img class="w-100" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2021-marketing-funnel-diagram.png" alt="A diagram of the EthicalAds marketing funnel"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our marketing funnel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="defining-success"&gt;Defining success&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there are a variety of onboarding locations that draw new users to our site
such as a tailored landing page from an ad,
a blog post linked from a third party site like HackerNews or Twitter,
or our home page from a search engine,
defining a "success" is trickier than it first seems.
There are some obvious win conditions such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An advertiser prospect fills out the "contact us" form on the Advertiser page
  which leads to a conversion (new advertiser account and paid invoice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A prospective publisher fills out the "contact us" form on the Publisher page
  which leads to a conversion (new publisher account and approved to host paid ads)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but there are also harder to quantify successes such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An interested visitor educates themself on Surveilance Advertising in our Learning Hub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A media-affiliated user fills out the generic "contact us" form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A potential advertiser or publisher navigates to a page, browses for awhile,
  and then fills out a "contact us" form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is our first marketing funnel,
we decided to focus on only the first two scenarios as "successes"
which is fairly simple since all of our contact us forms
result in the same "form submitted" page when filled out.
There are some drawbacks to this approach
such as spammy form submissions being considered successes or even
good leads for advertisers/publishers who simply didn't convert all of the way,
but opening a line of dialogue between us and the user seems to be the largest hurdle right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we defined opening a successful channel of communication as a success
even if it doesn't necessarily always result in a conversion.
Our forms contain only relevant information to an individual's request,
and is the only point in our marketing funnel where user PII is collected,
specifically their name and email address so that we may reply to their inquiry.
This alone however does not inform us as to how a user arrived on our site or how they heard about us.
For that we needed analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="open-source-analytics"&gt;Open-source analytics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After surveying a variety of open source analytics solutions, we decided to use Plausible.
They have a great article on why one ought to choose &lt;a href="https://plausible.io/vs-google-analytics"&gt;Plausible over Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;.
With a simple onboarding process, they provide a light weight, open source option to monitoring inbound traffic source statistics
in a privacy-preserving, aggregated format as well as tools for measuring successful conversions
(which we defined as contact form submissions) per traffic source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All we had to do was add a distinct &lt;code&gt;?ref&lt;/code&gt; tag for each ad url
to inform Plausible to aggregate the inbounds from that url as traffic from a distinct source.
We also added a &lt;code&gt;?ref&lt;/code&gt; to the 'ads by EthicalAds' link underneath every placement
and try to include them on our content distributions as well.
This identifier is displayed to the user in the url and is in no way personally identifying.
Check the url for this article! Did you see it on twitter or hackernews?
If so, the url should have a &lt;code&gt;?ref=twitter-ethical-funnel&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;?ref=hackernews-ethical-funnel&lt;/code&gt; at the end
which will go away once you explore the site as we don't track our users in our ads or locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can A/B test new ads and landing pages for advertisers and publishers
to determine which images, formats, and copy convince users to get in touch with us.
We can also see which types of content are generating not only large quantities of traffic,
but also good resonance traffic comprised of potential advertisers or publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to determine which ads or articles are generating not only the most traffic or form submissions,
but also are generating the most successes proportionally to the amount of traffic,
enables us to determine where we should spend our time marketing for the most value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've had our funnel up and running for a little over two months now
and are looking forward to sharing some preliminary results with y'all in a follow-up blog post.
If you have any more questions about how we set up our marketing funnel or EthicalAds in general,
please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@ethicalads.io"&gt;email us&lt;/a&gt;. We always love to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;

However, with many approaches to online advertising, your users could be sharing more with ad networks than you think.
You know some online advertising collects data about your visitors,
but maybe you aren't quite sure how that works or what you can do to stop it.
Are the ads you're running on your site spying on you and your users?
Here's some red flags:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Does your ad network allow advertisers to run their own scripts or load resources on your site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveillance tech:&lt;/strong&gt; Does your ad network use things like cross-site cookies, fingerprinting, or other tracking technologies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized targeting:&lt;/strong&gt; Does your ad network allow targeting that is so specific as to be nearly personal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cookie warnings:&lt;/strong&gt; Does your ad network recommend you have a cookie warning to comply with privacy regulation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data broker:&lt;/strong&gt; Does your ad network make money exclusively from ads? Or are they also selling user data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know the answers to the questions above for the ads running on your site.
Ask your ad network and see what they say.
Better yet, run a privacy scanner like &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;
on your site and see what user tracking technologies are running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="advertiser-provided-cookies-code-or-resources"&gt;Advertiser provided cookies, code, or resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the biggest things to watch out for when selecting an ad network
are advertiser provided resources, code, or cookies.
If an advertiser hosts the images or other resources for an advertisement,
they can cookie and track the users on your site across the web
(and then &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/05/how-invasive-ad-targeting-is-bad-for-journalism-and-other-high-quality-publishers/"&gt;show ads to your users more cheaply elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage"&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2021-third-party-resources.png"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-100" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2021-third-party-resources.png" alt="An ad network loading third-party resources"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An ad network loading third-party resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This image shows an ad network adding a Google tracking pixel along with the ad image.
This is used for large advertisers who want to have a report of all their ads in a single Google dashboard.
This site owner may not even know that their users are being sent to a third party,
and without looking at the actual HTML it's impossible to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse than loading a tracking pixel is to run JavaScript code
provided by advertisers.
In addition to being a security nightmare,
this allows for even more exfiltration of data from your site
including some cookie values or logged-in user data displayed on your site.
While common a decade ago, thankfully allowing advertisers to run code on publisher sites
has become rarer today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With EthicalAds, we vet all our advertisers
but we still never let them run arbitrary code or cookie users on your site.
We don't save a cookie from our domains either.
Advertising can work without knowing any personal details or past sites you've visited.
With us, you don't need a &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/02/can-you-eliminate-annoying-cookie-banners-from-your-site/"&gt;cookie warning banner&lt;/a&gt;
and the ads on your site will already comply with privacy regulation like the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fingerprinting-supercookies-and-other-nefarious-tracking-tech"&gt;Fingerprinting, supercookies, and other nefarious tracking tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some common browsers like Firefox and Safari already block many third-party cookies.
This is a great step toward a more private web.
However, to "work around" a lack of cookies, some ad networks use fingerprinting
in an attempt to uniquely identify visitors for ad targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingerprinting and other tracking tech can take a few forms but some of the most common are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browser Fingerprinting:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/what-fingerprinting"&gt;Browser fingerprinting&lt;/a&gt;,
  is the process of uniquely identifying individual users based on their browser
  and other data about them like their IP address.
  These browser attributes can be anything from how the browser identifies itself
  to settings you've changed to protect your privacy.
  Customizations can make your browser appear unique rather than look like everybody else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supercookies:&lt;/strong&gt; So called &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/01/26/supercookie-protections/"&gt;"supercookies"&lt;/a&gt;
  use trackers hidden in other parts of browser like local storage, ETags, or HSTS headers.
  These are not cleared by clearing cookies
  and can potentially identify users uniquely or be used in combination with fingerprinting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNAME Cloaking:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://webkit.org/blog/11338/cname-cloaking-and-bounce-tracking-defense/"&gt;CNAME Cloaking&lt;/a&gt;
  involves a publisher setting up a subdomain for an ad tech tracker.
  This can make a third-party cookie look like a first-party cookie and gets around most tracking protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these tracking methods are easy to spot.
If you see data from your ad network in local storage, that's a red flag.
However, for some forms of fingerprinting, it happens only on the ad network's servers
and you have no way of knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EthicalAds doesn't use any fingerprinting technology.
You don't need to trust us. All our code
&amp;mdash; both the &lt;a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-client"&gt;client&lt;/a&gt; that runs on your site
and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; serving the ads &amp;mdash; is open source.
We don't track users to target them with ads because we're confident in our contextual targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="contextual-targeting-works"&gt;Contextual targeting works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all offline advertising from billboards, TV or radio spots, or ads in magazines
use contextual targeting rather than personalized targeting.
This means that a company pays to show a billboard in an area where they believe their customers live or visit.
A relevant ad will appear in a magazine about a related topic or during a TV show about a similar topic
or that has the right audience.
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/"&gt;Our vision&lt;/a&gt; for advertising is built on this and applies it to the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising doesn't need to track your users to work well both for your site and for advertisers.
Our ads are targeted only on the content of the page where the ad will be displayed and very rough geography.

&lt;li&gt;Our new &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;prospectus&lt;/a&gt; came out.
  We raised the geo-prices in the US and EU in order to combat our overbooking issue and earn more money for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added a read replica database which improves the performance of our dashboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the advertiser dashboard, when you copy an advertisement to a new flight, they're ordered by the age of the ad, newest first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now when a 'Contact Us' form is filled out, we ask if they would like to start receiving our newsletter.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="september-advertising-stats"&gt;September advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$31,380.78&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;103 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;19,238,786&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September was our best month to date in terms of paid views and revenue!
We had a 12% increase in September's revenue from August which was a 15% increase from July before that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of our revenue improvements were due to price increases that went into effect over the last quarter
and partially due to selling more of our harder to sell inventory.
Our effective cost per thousand impressions (eCPM) has improved across the board.
The US &amp;amp; Canada eCPM has improved from $2.87 in June to $2.93 in September,
our APAC eCPM went from $0.56 in June to $0.68 in September,
and our EU eCPM went all the way from $2.40 to $2.92 in September.
This means more money in the pockets of our publishers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still have the fortunate problem of being overbooked in the US and EU especially,
which has resulted in many of our on-going campaigns falling behind schedule.
We've adjusted our roadmap priorities to focus more heavily on publisher acquisition.
We are also looking into additional ways of managing pricing,
so that we are able to better determine priority of ads across time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New landing pages describing our open source ad network and the benefits of being a data science publisher on our network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding graphs to our advertising dashboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure improvements to better manage our load and isolate reporting from our live transactional data.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started a number of new global campaigns this month which boosted our paid view count significantly,
although we are still limited by publishers across the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still have the fortunate problem of being overbooked in the US and EU especially,

We're also releasing our new prospectus in October, raising the price of these overbooked geos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our ad server, we added &lt;code&gt;noopener&lt;/code&gt; to our ad links as a security precaution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our ad server now raises a warning on link redirects and errors when advertisers are creating an ad, to make sure it isn't an error in the URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also in our ad server, we created actions to allow our staff to handle
  the creation and customization of new advertising flights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our website, we created our first iteration of an &lt;strong&gt;ethical&lt;/strong&gt; marketing funnel
  by implementing a transparent, human-readable first-person cookie,
  running the open-source, privacy-friendly &lt;a href="https://plausible.io/vs-google-analytics"&gt;Plausible analytics&lt;/a&gt;,
  and creating our first ad-specific landing page for &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publishers/topics/python/"&gt;prospective Python publishers&lt;/a&gt;.
  Lookout for a blog post on how we did it, coming out soon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also on our website, we launched our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/07/ethicalads-publisher-referral-offer-july-2021/"&gt;Publisher Referral Offer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$23,981.08&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;105 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;16,257,531&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July we undertook an effort to ensure the high quality of our network,
we removed a number of under-performing publishers
and onboardeded some new publishers, though we continue to &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/07/ethicalads-publisher-referral-offer-july-2021/"&gt;look for more&lt;/a&gt;!
We also launched a few globally-targeted ad-buys which resulted in a sizable increase of views from June's ~14.6 million paid views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still verging on max capacity with regards to ad inventory specifically in the US and EU.
We focused our efforts this month are marketing in order to attract new publishers.
We rolled out our new marketing funnel and were even featured on
&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27987650"&gt;HackerNews&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27975685"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;.
Unfortunately, determining the success of these new endeavors
takes time as we don't want to change too many variables at once,
lest we not know which avenues had the greatest impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing a view time metric for our ads to ensure a fair system for counting valid views
  as well as provide a metric for publisher quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Releasing our Surveillance Advertising informational page to the Learning Hub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating our Publisher Guide with new examples of superior placements
  and some explanation as to why they are so desirable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

and our journey in building a business around the intersection of the two.
This post is going to go under the hood and discuss some of the technology and scaling challenges
we ran into with our ad server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage"&gt;
 &lt;img class="w-100" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2021-adserver-performance-throughput.png" alt="Ethical ad server throughput on a normal week"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Normal throughput of our ad server peaks at about 3,500 requests per minute which is ~60 requests per second. The small drops are nights and the big ones are weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="breaking-out-the-ad-server"&gt;Breaking out the ad server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before late 2019, ads on Read the Docs were served by a Django app that was actually part of the Read the Docs code line.
We knew we wanted to break it out into a separate service to prepare for launching our ad network.
However, the process was a bit tricky since we knew that on day one this new server
would need to handle around 20-30 requests per second and traffic spikes could take that number to 60 or higher.
To prepare for this, we relentlessly focused on our app performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, Python and Django are not considered the most performant language and framework.
We didn't want to do a from-scratch rewrite, however, in a more performant language.
There was also a strong desire to use a similar setup to Read the Docs
as that's what our small team (of 5 at that time) knew well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve the performance, we actually spent quite a bit of time digging through New Relic traces
and going over each Postgres query in &lt;a href="https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;Django Debug Toolbar&lt;/a&gt;.
For an ad server like ours, just a few different APIs -- like requesting an ad and viewing an ad --
account for almost all transactions.
We even have unit tests to ensure the number of database queries doesn't change in these APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were pretty confident that the ad server was ready to go live code-wise,
we did some load testing to make sure it could handle the traffic.
There were definitely a few false starts during the initial rollout
and in the end we decided to put it through a full load test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="load-testing-our-ad-server"&gt;Load testing our ad server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure we could handle the load we knew we were going to see once we rolled out the ad server,
we did a staging deployment to Heroku and to &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/"&gt;Azure's AppService&lt;/a&gt;
to compare how they performed.
This wasn't particularly complex given that this app was structured to be cloud agnostic from the start.
After that, we used &lt;a href="https://github.com/JoeDog/siege"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt; to test the deployment
at various loads up to 100 ad requests per second.
These were real requests exactly like we'd see in production and we wanted to see how staging would cope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Heroku (4 Standard-2x dynos, 10 Gunicorn processes each, ~$200/mo)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty standard Heroku setup to handle a performance heavy application.
  We tested it at various thoughputs but it was able to handle 100 requests per second without dropping requests.
  However, we did see our 99th percentile performance (p99) creep up to the 550-600ms range which is pretty bad.
  On Heroku, 100 concurrent requests would also bump us into some pricier Redis and Postgres setups
  to handle over 100 connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Heroku (10 Standard-2x dynos, 10 Gunicorn processes each, ~$500/mo)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we more than doubled the provisioning.
  This setup performed much better although it didn't seem to be exactly linearly better which was a little odd.
  Our p99 was closer to 350ms in a 100 requests per second setup and it didn't drop any requests.
  The median performance (p50) stayed about the same at 80-90ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;AppService (4 Premium P1s, 10 Gunicorn processes each, ~$300/mo)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a pretty comparable setup in Azure to the Heroku setups.
  We ran the exact same code and the configuration was as close as possible.
  We tested various numbers of instances and the performance scaled very linearly with instance count.
  Performance was quite a bit better with a p50 of ~75ms and the p99 was drastically improved to ~200ms.
  Even in longer and larger tests (with more instances in some cases),
  we saw much better performance on AppService than on Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result of the load tests was that we launched the ad server on AppService
where got predictable performance and the right bang for the buck.
Heroku definitely wins in ease of deployment and it has a lot of advantages and flexibility.
However, for this kind of application where performance and predictability were critical,
AppService was the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage"&gt;
 &lt;img class="w-100" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2021-adserver-performance-percentile.png" alt="Normal real-world performance from New Relic"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;With our current performance over a normal week, New Relic reports our p50 at 58ms and the p99 at 105ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="performance-today"&gt;Performance today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months after rolling things out to production we encountered some issues with AppService.
In response, we switched to autoscaled &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview"&gt;VM scaling sets&lt;/a&gt;.
Using the same siege setup, we were able to show that VM scaling sets
(which we also use on Read the Docs) not only scaled better
but also cut about 15ms off of our p50.
We aren't sure why they're faster but we assume it's some overhead with AppService and containerization.
That doesn't sound like much but it's actually quite a lot when
you consider we didn't change the database or ad server code whatsoever.
Except under unusual load, we're usually scaled to about 3-4 instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've done a few further optimizations like reducing cache requests to Redis
(the fastest request is the one you don't have to make).
Currently, about 20ms of a normal request is taken in Python
while the remainder is consumed in Postgres and Redis.
This shows the upper bound of any framework or language optimizations.
Django and Python may be slow but at most replacing them could shave 10-15ms off our performance.
Improvements on our infrastructure or how we handle data would yield better results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage"&gt;
 &lt;img class="w-100" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2021-adserver-performance-breakdown.png" alt="Performance breakdown of the ad server"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A little over half our server time is spent in Postgres while Python is just under half&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="our-next-scaling-challenge"&gt;Our next scaling challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next big scaling challenge is how to have good performance on different continents.
We can optimize server performance all we want but Europe and Asia are 80-100ms worse due purely to latency.
Currently, our source of truth is what is in our Postgres database
and reworking our solution to actually process ad requests at the edge will be a big change.
This will be more complex than CDN edge caching since most of our requests involve DB writes.
Multi-writer scenarios for databases are never easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our ad server, we updated the weighting algorithm to slightly bias showing CPC ads on higher CTR publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our ad server now tracks historical changes to ad campaigns,
  allowing us to track changes over time to better understand performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also in our ad server, we added actions to allow our staff to handle
  adding new publishers and processing publisher payouts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our website, we updated our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;prospectus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/#pricing"&gt;pricing&lt;/a&gt; information for Q3.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="june-advertising-stats"&gt;June advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June was a slight improvement over May for advertising
as we had some new ad buys start as well as a couple new publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$24,362.13&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.
  Of this, $12,696.56 was to third-party publishers, with the rest to Read the Docs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;106 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;14,574,934&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminder, we are actively working to onboard
new, high quality publishers, which will expand our ad inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still verging on max capacity with regards to ad inventory.
We slightly raised our prices in Q3 in our high demand areas to address this.
Also, we rolled out a number of new house ads across the network to find new publishers.
Unfortunately, determining the success of these new ads is difficult
without using common third-party tools that track users.
We are looking into privacy preserving analytics options for our website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a staff interface for customizing ad flights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are still not sure of the best way to implement referrals.
  We might try something simple to see if it works, and build on it if we find that it works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View time for ads will allow us to ensure a fair system for counting valid views
  as well as provide a metric for publisher quality.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Also in our ad server, we added actions to allow our staff to better assist in
  the creation, modification, and management of advertisers and their campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our website, we updated and streamlined our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/#community-ads"&gt;Community Ad&lt;/a&gt; information.
  Now open source community projects can apply to have their ads run for free
  by like-minded publishers when a paid ad is not available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also recently launched our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/learning-hub/"&gt;Learning Hub&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2 id="may-advertising-stats"&gt;May advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May was a great month for advertising as we had some new ad buys start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$23,495.17&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.
  Of this, $11,719.57 was to third-party publishers, with the rest to Read the Docs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;104 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;14,659,563&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, we undertook an effort to increase the performance of publishers
with the lowest Click Through Rates.
In some cases, we were able to increase performance
while in others, we agreed to part ways.
As we approach our ad capacity, we are actively working to onboard
new, high quality publishers, which will expand our ad inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="learning-hub"&gt;Learning Hub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discover more about EthicalAds right from the navigation bar!
Our new &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/learning-hub/"&gt;Learning Hub&lt;/a&gt; collects information regarding
who we are, our vision for the future of advertising,
and statistics on the make-up of our audience. It also contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advertiser's Guide which details how to craft a great advertisement
  for &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; audience including insights into what has worked well in the past.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are on the verge of max capacity with regards to ad inventory.
With our processes becoming more standardized, allowing new staff to handle day to day operations,
we are now ready to focus on growing the network.
Marketing and growth is a challenge for any small business.
Thankfully, an advertising network gets better as it grows bigger.
More advertisers means more money for publishers and
more publishers means a larger pool of specific topics for advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most recent changes to targeting will be highlighted in the advertiser's dashboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are designing a referral system for our current publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad Click prioritization will be coming to our network.
  Advertisers who pay per click will be matched with
  publishers who have high click through rates.&lt;/li&gt;

you’d buy ad space on a billboard where those people are likely to see it
or buy an ad spot in a newspaper section that your target market reads.
On the internet before hyper-targeted advertising,
this meant finding an online publication for your product
or buying up specific, relevant terms on search engines.
If you plan to introduce a new line of cat food?
You run an ad on &lt;a href="https://moderncat.com"&gt;ModernCat.com&lt;/a&gt;
or you pay to take the top search engine result for "cat food".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rise of ad tech powered by personal data collection,
advertisers can reach cat lovers (or any targeted group)
by paying ad tech companies to show their ads wherever the audience goes.
Maybe you pay top dollar for ModernCat.com for a little while,
but after you've got cookies to track their visitors onto other sites,
you can reach the same folks on lower quality channels more cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of this intrusive targeting and tracking people across sites is a race to the bottom.
Advertising dollars have moved away from publications with well researched content written by knowledgeable authors
to low quality SEO optimized sites with re-purposed material developed to maximize paid ad impressions.
While there are a lot of reasons for the fall of newspapers, this dynamic shift is a major factor.
Instead of spending money on investigative reporters,
it makes more economic sense to churn out clickbait that rephrases research done elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, all impressions are the same from an ad tech perspective.
It doesn't matter if ads appear on the paper of record or on a clickbait site
if they reach a similar audience.
Ad views have become a commodity.
For most ad-funded sites including many newspapers,
the race for views comes at the cost of sacrificing quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-publishers-can-do-about-it"&gt;What publishers can do about it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers can take back their audience and advertising revenue in a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut off ad tech surveillance technology.&lt;/strong&gt;
  Ad tech is driven by personal data which, with some exceptions, is collected from individual publishers sites
  through the use of third-party cookies, fingerprinting, and other tracking technologies.
  Publishers should eliminate or severely restrict what ad tech can run on their site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop providing ad space for tracking companies to show ads.&lt;/strong&gt;
  Where it isn't possible to restrict the ad network in terms of tracking,
  remove ads that track users completely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean giving up your ad revenue, though.
While there seems to be unlimited ad space online there is a very limited amount of quality ad space.
Larger publishers can work directly with advertisers to privately place ads often driving up their own revenue
&lt;a href="https://open.nytimes.com/to-serve-better-ads-we-built-our-own-data-program-c5e039bf247b"&gt;as the New York Times did&lt;/a&gt;.
For publishers that are too small or unable to hire a sales force,
they can find an ad network that will place ads without sacrificing user privacy
or siphoning off their audience's data for the ad network's gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving small and mid-size publishers a way to monetize their audience without giving up their privacy
is the reason we built the EthicalAds network.
There are lots of developer-focused sites that are too small to sell ads directly.
If you're looking for an ad network that won't compromise your audience,
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publishers/"&gt;join EthicalAds&lt;/a&gt; and help preserve privacy on the web!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to backpeddle. "No one is personally listening in to your conversations, grandma, it was an analogy …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2 id="about-me"&gt;About Me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to backpeddle. "No one is personally listening in to your conversations, grandma, it was an analogy." Explaining my new job to my grandmother was not going well. Bemoaning the evils of modern Ad Tech by highlighting how coporations were tracking her around the web &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; not have been the wisest approach. Knowing that my grandmother is an avid online shopper, I tried another tact, "You know how when you're reading the news, you get those big flashy banners for stuff you already looked at and decided to not buy?"  "Oh, I see those all of the time!" Progress. "Yeah! They're big and flashy and purposefully annoying in order to distract you? My company is an advertising network that connects developer-focused publishers," "Developers?" Right, to my grandmother a developer worked in real estate. "Coders, like me - we connect techy publishers with relevant, respectful ads for products that actually work. And we do it without storing any information about you or what you were looking at!" My enthusiasm was met with silence and I was worried that I'd lost her again, "Grandma?" Hesitantly she spoke, "But does &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; work? Honey, my dad always said the louder the soap salesman, the more soap he'll sell." She then told me a story of her father, my great-grandfather, who was in fact a soap salesman himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One morning in the summer of 1938, my great-grandfather was out for a walk by the river early and he noticed people washing their clothing in the river without bar soap. He decided then and there to tap that market and would go down on his walk every morning with a box full of soap to sell. Selling by the river early in the morning before the factory opened worked incredibly well, until other soap vendors realized the simplistic brilliance of his approach. Soon my great-grandfather was in competition and learned that he had to get creative with drawing attention. My grandmother cautioned me, "The loud, charismatic vendor inevitably sells more soap than the quiet, reserved one." Oy. This is the mindset that has been shaping advertising for the past 100 years; this is how we have arrived at the current state of the internet, almost unbrowsable without an ad-blocker thanks to pop-ups, banner ads, and booby-trapped x's. At least, we were getting somewhere. She definitely understood that our publishers were our river and that we are the soap-sellers, but how do I explain ad-blockers? So I asked my grandma "What if yelling was out-lawed?" "Make yelling illegal?" she repeated incredulously. I told her a little bit about how ad-blockers worked, mildly surprised that I hadn't already set her up with one when I set up her laptop, and explained that EthicalAds gets around ad-blockers &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; our ads are quiet and reserved. "Hmmm..."  After careful consideration, she made up her mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You have your foot in the door, not a seat at the table. Have you considered making your ads &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;~beautiful~&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm Ra Cohen: data scientist, people person, and the latest addition to the EthicalAds team. Using pretty pictures, willful words, and data science, I'm on a mission to help people reach their audience and tell their story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pretty-pictures"&gt;Pretty Pictures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a data scientist, I know just how much impact framing and perspective can have on impressions. A graph zoomed in around all of the action will tell a very different, more turbulent story than the same data presented on a graph with its origin at 0. My design philosophy draws from the Data-Ink ratio principle. The less ink you can use over all, the better, and that ink which you do use should be fundamental to conveying your data. I'm excited to apply my eye for artistry not only in illuminating the beauty of data, but also to illustrate the beauty of advertising. Beauty captures our attention like nothing else, stirring us to action with the promise of a better tomorrow. Is that not also the goal of advertising? To reincarnate Helen of Troy into the image that launches a thousand clicks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A picture may be worth a thousand words, but context can make it worth a million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="willful-words"&gt;Willful Words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good writing is the intersection of clarity and purpose. Conveying information and motivating one's audience are best accomplished by the &lt;strong&gt;willful word&lt;/strong&gt;, a word mindfully chosen to perform work and left free of clutter. Due to the brevity of advertising, the creatively willful word thrives. The attention of your reader is valuable and respected. We are happy to assist in the creation of your advertising copy upon request. Your time is valuable too, so I endeavor to keep all emails to the point as I assist with advertiser and publisher account management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also happy to schedule a phone call to discuss your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="data-science"&gt;Data Science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all science, the first step to data science is to ask a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Are you a publisher who wants help understanding how our latest updates affected your profits? Or do you want to compare your data over a few ad placement spots in order to maximise your click through rates? Perhaps you're an advertiser who wants to know how changing your targeting will affect your total number of impressions. Send us an email; I breathe data! In school, I took courses in our data science graduate program to fulfil my undergrad computer science requirements. After graduation, I went to work as a research scientsit for two years where I built visualization dashboard prototypes for DARPA. I'm glad to now be working at EthicalAds, shaping the future of advertising for a more respectful, beautiful future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we are thrilled to have you along with us on our journey to build an ethical ad network.

&lt;p&gt;Here's the major features we added in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our ad client, we made some improvements …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the major features we added in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our ad client, we made some improvements to our contextual targeting.
  We now parse pages where ads will appear to discover their main topics in order to better target them
  with the right kind of ad. As always, we focus on content and contextual targeting,
  not targeting ads based on learning about users or about past actions users have taken.
  While we've only taken the first steps here, the end result is greatly improved targeting
  and the ability to target more niches with high quality ads which is one of the keys to good ad performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our ad server, we made a number of small improvements for our advertisers to improve their workflows
  and better allow them to make decisions to improve ad performance.
  This included better ways to compare past performance to current performance and the ability to easily re-use
  past high-performing ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also took the first steps toward prioritizing higher performing and higher priced ads.
  We believe this is the right step to ensure that publishers are getting the most they can from their ad spots,
  while giving advertisers incentives to produce high quality ads.
  While we expect this will drive a slight increase in publisher revenue, so far the impact has been very small.
  We are continuing to make improvements to ad prioritization in May and beyond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest server updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="april-advertising-stats"&gt;April advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April was an interesting month for advertising
as we had rolled out some of our contextual targeting changes and had some new ad buys start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$23,831.85&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.
  Of this, $12,154.71 was to third-party publishers, with the rest to Read the Docs.
  While not a surprise, this was an all-time record for our third-party publishers!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;101 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;17,507,857&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.
  The biggest reason for a large increase in ad views was that we received a couple ad buys
  with nearly global targeting.
  While these don't always bring in lots of revenue as global targeting isn't very expensive,
  they can have a big impact on the total number of ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, May is looking to continue the gains that we made in April
but if we are able to close a few ad buys we have in the pipeline,
that could put our revenue over the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-hire"&gt;New hire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the hiring front, we were able to find a talented person to help with advertiser and publisher account management.
Ra Cohen brings a background in machine learning and a passion for connecting with people
to our small corner of the ads industry.
Expect a full introduction in the next couple weeks.
We are lucky to have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the hiring complete, onboarding will probably be the trickiest part in the immediate future.
Bringing on a new person is always hard when it's done well and we expect this won't be any different.
This will involve making a lot of processes we have more regular but in the long term
we expect this will lead to better outcomes and faster response times for our publishers and advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the improvements we've been able to make on ad prioritization,
  we will be rolling out the ability to have "flex advertisers".
  This will give advertisers who opt-in to this program lower prices but without guaranteed inventory.
  This helps us ensure that as many ad slots have paid ads for our publishers while letting us balance our inventory.
  In the &lt;em&gt;much longer&lt;/em&gt; term, we see this as a first-step toward a form of bidding for ads
  that will be familiar to advertisers used to the big ad networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are building improvements into both our ad client and ad server to improve our contextual targeting.
  We believe that good contextual targeting is one of the keys to our network's success.
  This lets advertisers reach the audience they want as well as possible without creepy targeting
  and without requiring publishers to do the work of categorizing all their content.
  By automatically categorizing content, we'll have more inventory for more niches that advertisers want to target.
  For publishers, this is also a win because better targeted ads cost more and bring in more revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March was another record month ever for advertising

&lt;p&gt;March was another record month ever for advertising
although &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/03/ethicalads-newsletter-february-2021/"&gt;February&lt;/a&gt; was better per day due to being a shorter month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$23,994.57&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers, another record but only 1% over February.
  Of this, $10,711.54 was to third-party publishers, with the rest to Read the Docs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;104 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;14,768,103&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expected revenue to publishers other than Read the Docs to exceed our own revenue in March and that didn't happen.
However, that looks nearly certain in April due to some larger advertisers shifting toward the wider ad network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the major features we added in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the business side, we released a &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/press/"&gt;media kit&lt;/a&gt;
  to help us get more traction and be part of the privacy conversation around advertising
  which is an important goal and requires constant effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our ad server, we made a number of reporting improvements for both publishers and advertisers.
  These included showing more data, giving more high level overviews of data, and speeding up our existing reports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We started automatically including the publisher name when redirecting to an advertiser's site.
  The advertising industry could use a bit of transparency
  and advertisers sometimes don't know where their ads are being shown.
  Our aim is to be as transparent as possible and give advertisers the ability to make more informed decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made a small tweak to our ad display algorithm when the same person requests multiple ads within a few seconds.
  We now cache the ad and show the exact same ad and only bill advertisers a single impression for it.
  For most publishers, this made almost no difference but for some this resulted in fewer ad views being counted
  and therefore less revenue.
  We believe this is more fair to advertisers and incentivizes publishers to have good ad placements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our infrastructure, we've solved most of our performance/IO problems from the previous month.
  We are archiving data out of our transactional database on a regular basis after it is processed
  to help with performance.
  Longer term, we will probably use a separate reporting database for both performance
  but for now, we're keeping it simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest server updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still aim to hire an &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/jobs/account-manager-part-time/"&gt;account manager&lt;/a&gt;
to help manage advertiser and publisher relationships.
Initially, we were looking for somebody to work around 20 hours per week
but we've added a bit more range -- 20 to 32 hours -- to give the role a bit more flexibility.
We're looking for somebody who is early in their career or returning to their previous career
and wants to ease into it with a flexible position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring is always hard and takes a lot of time to do well.
If this role sounds interesting to you,
please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@ethicalads.io?subject=Ads%20account%20manager%20role"&gt;get in touch with any questions&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/jobs/account-manager-part-time/"&gt;apply&lt;/a&gt;!
In addition, Read the Docs is hiring a &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/job-frontend/"&gt;frontend developer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beginning in April, we're going to expand our advertising logic to take into account an ad's price and performance
  when choosing which ad to show.
  One advertiser has agreed to be a flex advertiser with part of their ad buys in Q2
  which will give them lower prices but not guaranteed inventory and this feature was a necessary step.
  This helps us ensure that as many ad slots have paid ads for our publishers while letting us balance our inventory.
  Initially, we expect this will drive a slight increase in revenue to publishers as we prioritize higher priced ads.
  Longer term, this aligns incentives to have better performing ads for advertisers and better performing placements on publisher sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are building improvements into both our ad client and ad server to improve our contextual targeting.
  We believe that good contextual targeting is one of the keys to our network's success.
  This lets advertisers reach the audience they want as well as possible without creepy targeting
  and without requiring publishers to do the work of categorizing all their content.
  By automatically categorizing content, we'll have more inventory for more niches that advertisers want to target.
  For publishers, this is also a win because better targeted ads cost more and bring in more revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the last few months, we mentioned supporting custom ad formats as a sort of sponsorship.
  This has been deprioritized for now in favor of other improvements.
  However, we did get some interest on the sponsorship side.
  Some larger sites expressed interest in using our ad server to manage their own internal sponsorships
  while using our management interface and reporting.
  Depending on demand, we may build some more features around that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.

that after they phase out third-party cookies in Chrome next year,
they "will not build alternate identifiers to track individuals as they browse across the web."
On the surface, this looks like a win for a more private web.
This would put Chrome, the most popular browser, on a similar footing to Safari and Firefox
which block most third-party tracking out of the box.
As more details started to come out about Google's vision, however,
things started to get a bit murkier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="googles-vision-for-the-future-of-ads"&gt;Google's vision for the future of ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Google's vision, ads targeted to users' interests aren't going away but are merely changing.
Built on Google's &lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox"&gt;Privacy Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;,
which is part of the open source engine behind Chrome,
Google promises these changes will create a more private web
while keeping targeted advertising just as effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Advances in aggregation, anonymization, on-device processing and other privacy-preserving technologies offer a clear path to replacing individual identifiers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Temkin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Director of Product Management, Ads Privacy and Trust at Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of ad networks or ad tech companies keeping and storing data on users to target them with ads,
Google is testing an approach they call &lt;a href="https://github.com/WICG/floc"&gt;Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC)&lt;/a&gt;
which will have your browser learn about the things you like so you can be targeted with ads.
Likewise, for personalized ads, they have another approach called &lt;a href="https://github.com/WICG/turtledove"&gt;Turtledove&lt;/a&gt;.
These will expose new browser APIs that advertisers and ad networks can use to target ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake,
while these changes have some privacy benefits, they also are about control.
Google's vision for ads put them at the center of the ads ecosystem.
Google controls the browser you're probably using right now
and they'll control how these new tools and APIs like FLoC can be used for advertising.
In addition, Google has a first-party relationship with you and they don't need third-party cookies.
They can continue to use the emails you receive in Gmail,
the places you get directions to in Google Maps, the videos you watch on YouTube,
and the things you search for on Google to target you with ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) called FLoC a "terrible idea"&lt;/a&gt;.
They say it will help ad tech companies fingerprint users
so they can uniquely identify them more easily.
Any site which supports logging in could easily request FLoC data and add it to users' data profiles,
connecting that with the existing personal information they have on this user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-ad-tech-companies-are-doing-about-it"&gt;What ad tech companies are doing about it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response from the ad tech side of the industry ranges
depending on where the company sits in the ecosystem.
Even if Google's vision doesn't become a reality
-- we expect some of it will and some of it won't --
the end of third-party cookies won't be the death knell for ad tech,
behavioral targeting, or personalized ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of alternatives to cookies for tracking users across the web which are more invasive.
For many ad tech players, third-party cookies going away won't affect them at all because they use these methods of tracking.
The list of the techniques used to circumvent cookie restrictions
is potentially endless but here are some common techniques:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fingerprinting:&lt;/strong&gt; As the EFF called out, fingerprinting,
  or the process of uniquely identifying individual users based on their browser
  and other data about them like their IP address is common practice in the ad tech space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supercookies:&lt;/strong&gt; So called &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/01/26/supercookie-protections/"&gt;"supercookies"&lt;/a&gt;
  use trackers hidden in other parts of browser like ETags or HSTS headers.
  These are not cleared by clearing cookies and can potentially identify users uniquely or be used with fingerprinting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNAME Cloaking:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://webkit.org/blog/11338/cname-cloaking-and-bounce-tracking-defense/"&gt;CNAME Cloaking&lt;/a&gt;
  involves a publisher setting up a subdomain for an ad tech tracker so it appears as a first-party domain for cookie purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisers and ad tech companies are also leery of Google having too much control.
With states like California and Virginia adopting privacy legislation,
they know the privacy landscape is changing and some of them are trying to get in front of it with their own proposals.
The Trade Desk, an ad tech company,
has an alternative approach they call &lt;a href="https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/about-us/industry-initiatives/unified-id-solution-2-0"&gt;Unified ID 2.0&lt;/a&gt;.
This will only work for sites and apps that support logins
since it operates off of hashed email addresses, but once logged in,
users can be targeted with personalized ads.
While this isn't an approach we want to see become the norm, it is at least upfront and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, some companies are trying to pressure Google and other players into slowing or reversing these changes.
When Apple's iOS 14 required apps using ad tracking to request user permission,
Facebook cried foul and is claiming that these &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-idfa-ios14-small-business/"&gt;privacy protections hurt small businesses&lt;/a&gt;.
The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) at the request of advertising market participants
is specifically investigating the changes to Chrome and the Privacy Sandbox.
Only the big ad players want to keep the status quo for ad tracking.
These tactics might delay things, but with users and governments asking for privacy improvements, they're going to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generally oppose all of these attempts at tracking users across the web,
and are building on a more privacy-focused foundation of contextual ad targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-do-these-changes-affect-ethical-advertising"&gt;How do these changes affect ethical advertising?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our small ethical advertising segment of the industry,
these changes will have pretty minimal effect.
Third-party cookies and all their prospective replacements
are all about gathering information on you (and millions of people like you)
in order to target ads to you based on your interests or to you personally.
Ethical advertising doesn't use third-party cookies
and doesn't store personal information.
We aren't trying to show ads to you personally, but instead
like traditional advertising on TV, in newspapers, or in magazines,
ethical ads are targeted to the content of the page.
We put ads for developers on developer focused sites. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February was our best month ever for advertising.
Despite being a shorter month, we were still able to beat our previous bests from &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/02/ethicalads-newsletter-january-2021/"&gt;January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$23,854.36&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.
  Of this, $11,671.47 was publishers other than our own publisher (Read the Docs) which is a 5.5% increase over January.
  Going forward, we're going to report these numbers together.
  In March and beyond, we expect the revenue to outside publishers will surpass revenue to our own site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;106 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;13,600,740&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're working hard to grow revenue for all our publishers, and we're expecting another record month in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the major features we added in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the business side, we released our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;Q2 prospectus&lt;/a&gt;
  which contains some of our new testimonials and some small additions like mentioning that CPC-based pricing is available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our ad client, we rolled out our dark mode improvements
  built on &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme"&gt;&lt;code&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  to our beta client which is used by Read the Docs. This means sites that want to try it out can do so.
  Some Sphinx documentation themes already are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our ad server, we improved a few reports (notably a report required by &lt;a href="https://acceptableads.com/"&gt;Acceptable Ads&lt;/a&gt;)
  and made some tweaks to speed up our throughput.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our infrastructure, we're really pushing the I/O on our server which is writing tens of times per second.
  We worked to try to alleviate some of this pressure and that will continue into March.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While not strictly ads related, Read the Docs did extend an offer to a new person to join our team!
  More on that later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still aim to hire a part-time &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/jobs/account-manager-part-time/"&gt;account manager&lt;/a&gt;
to help manage advertiser and publisher relationships.
Hiring is always hard and takes a lot of time to do well.
If this role sounds interesting to you,
please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@ethicalads.io?subject=Ads%20account%20manager%20role"&gt;get in touch with any questions&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/jobs/account-manager-part-time/"&gt;apply&lt;/a&gt;!
In addition, Read the Docs is hiring a &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/job-frontend/"&gt;frontend developer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure will continue to cause some headaches in the next few months.
Read the Docs Community completed a move from Azure to AWS in February
and EthicalAds will probably follow suit in the next few months.
In addition, we've been hitting I/O limits as I mentioned above and while we've made improvements there
and our latency is pretty darn good, we still want to do more.
Our data points pretty directly to faster ads performing better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to give both advertisers and publishers high level data right in their dashboard when they first login.
  These are stats like exactly how much advertising money they've spent or earned this month
  and how this month compares with last month.
  This feature is still on our roadmap but we didn't wrap it up in February.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're going to expand our advertising logic to take into account price when selecting ads.
  One advertiser has agreed to be a flex advertiser with part of their ad buys in Q2
  which will give them lower prices but not guaranteed inventory.
  This helps us ensure that as many ad slots have paid ads for our publishers while letting us balance our inventory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One publisher agreed to try out EthicalAds for some custom ad placements with non-standard sizes
  and per-month pricing rather than CPM.
  We have begun pitching this to advertisers and we may build some additional features to better support this based on interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
Please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@ethicalads.io"&gt;email us&lt;/a&gt; if you have any ideas or feedback on our product or roadmap,

with its cookie consent policy, internet users have had unavoidable pop-up messages
thrust onto their screens on every page urging them to "accept all" cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside for a moment how that has conditioned people to discard their privacy with a single click,
the experience is challenging on laptops. On mobile, it can be especially painful
with the cookie banner often occupying the majority of the smartphone's screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width: 300px; margin: 2rem auto;"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-100" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2021-cookie-banners-ft-example.png" alt="A cookie banner on the Financial Times taking up about half the screen"&gt;
  &lt;p class="text-center"&gt;&lt;small&gt;A cookie banner on the Financial Times taking up about half the screen&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-exactly-are-these-cookie-banners-needed"&gt;Why exactly are these cookie banners needed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://gdpr.eu/cookies/"&gt;EU's GDPR&lt;/a&gt; requires that web sites get consent from visitors &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; setting any non-essential cookies.
"Non-Essential Cookies" are those that are not strictly required for your site to function.
For example, a cookie to keep you logged in may be essential but an analytics cookie from a third-party would not be.
&lt;a href="https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa"&gt;California's Consumer Privacy Act&lt;/a&gt; (CCPA) requires only that visitors be notified of the use of cookies
if they are used for the purpose of collecting personal information; consent is not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-can-a-site-eliminate-cookie-banners"&gt;How can a site eliminate cookie banners?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple in theory, but can be difficult depending on how your site works.
If you don't collect personal information or allow third parties to collect personal information
and you only set essential cookies,
you will not need to set a cookie banner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most sites, the cookies that trigger the laws and violate user privacy are advertising cookies
and website analytics.
Until recently these have been difficult to do without.
Advertising is a proven business model for high traffic websites
and analytics are critical to understanding your site and users.
However, the internet has responded to users demand for increased privacy by providing privacy-aware services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="privacy-oriented-services-that-eliminate-the-requirement-of-cookie-banners"&gt;Privacy-oriented services that eliminate the requirement of cookie banners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to analytics, the internet has seen a host of alternatives to industry giant Google Analytics come to market.
They include &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/"&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://usefathom.com"&gt;Fathom&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://plausible.io/"&gt;Plausible&lt;/a&gt; and more.
These either don't set cookies at all or can easily be configured not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a solution for internet advertising that doesn't trigger cookie banners or violate user privacy has been a larger challenge.
Some ad tech companies are working hard to keep tracking and targeting users without cookies.
This may meet the letter of the law, but definitely violates its intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the many reasons we built EthicalAds.
Our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/"&gt;vision for advertising&lt;/a&gt; is that ads can work well without tracking users.
Instead of setting advertising cookies and learning from users' browsing history,
we focus by advertising only to developers and target ads based on content alone.
And &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2018/04/ethical-advertising-works/"&gt;this approach works&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're tired of seeing a cookie banner on your site,
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publishers/"&gt;join EthicalAds&lt;/a&gt; and ditch those annoying banners!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Greg Muscarella for the inspiration and feedback on this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="cookies"></category></entry><entry><title>EthicalAds Newsletter - January 2021</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/02/ethicalads-newsletter-january-2021/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-02-08T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-02-08T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>David Fischer</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2021-02-08:/blog/2021/02/ethicalads-newsletter-january-2021/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="january-advertising-stats"&gt;January advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;

While the year always …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2 id="january-advertising-stats"&gt;January advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, we returned to growth as expected from a slow holiday season.
While the year always starts a little slow, January started with a lot of advertiser interest and publishers
interested in making money with ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$10,566.78&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers, a 12% increase from December and 5% increase from November, our previous peak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;103 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;6,095,608&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Docs, our own publisher, generated &lt;strong&gt;$16,381.53&lt;/strong&gt; on 6,929,551 paid ad impressions. Of our reported metrics, this was the only one down slightly and it was due to a few large advertisers balancing their spend between Read the Docs and our larger ad network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For February, we are expecting another record breaking month in terms of daily traffic, daily revenue, and ads served.
It may not be as high as January in total (it'll be very close) but that's simply due to the number of days in the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the major features we added in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our ad client, we built a feature that allows ads to be displayed in light-mode or dark-mode
  based on the user's preferences if the publisher displaying the ad also supports this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our ad server, we added a number of quality of life improvements,
  including automating some advertiser setup and fixing some minor data consistency bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our infrastructure, we started archiving old, raw data on ad impressions
  (remember, we &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/"&gt;do not track user personal data&lt;/a&gt;)
  to keep our transactional database small and fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our website, we put up a job opening which we'll talk about in the next section.
  We also launched some more advertiser and publisher testimonials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="growing-our-team"&gt;Growing our team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We posted a new part-time &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/jobs/account-manager-part-time/"&gt;job opening&lt;/a&gt;
and we're hoping to bring somebody on to help manage advertiser and publisher relationships.
The job is going to be heavy on customer service but has some
light sales and marketing involved too.
This person will have a lot of impact on how EthicalAds continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person will work directly with me (David) and with Eric
to make sure our publishers are getting as much money as they can
while our advertisers are getting the best results we can deliver.
We pride ourselves on the high level of service we provide,
and working closely with both publishers and advertisers helps to get great results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this role sounds interesting to you,
please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@ethicalads.io?subject=Ads%20account%20manager%20role"&gt;get in touch with any questions&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/jobs/account-manager-part-time/"&gt;apply&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Read the Docs is hiring a &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/job-frontend/"&gt;frontend developer&lt;/a&gt;
and a &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/job-devrel/"&gt;developer advocate with documentation skills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned in December, hiring and onboarding new team members are hard work and require a lot of time to do well.
Now that we've started getting applications, we expect that this will take some time
but the end result will hopefully be faster responses to our advertisers and publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring new people really can't come soon enough.
Between the the time spent on hiring (which is very important to get right),
time spent on working on &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/czi-grant-announcement/"&gt;Read the Docs' CZI grant&lt;/a&gt;,
and some upcoming infrastructure changes at Read the Docs,
we're all feeling spread a bit thin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to give both advertisers and publishers high level data right in their dashboard when they first login.
  These are stats like exactly how much advertising money they've spent or earned this month
  and how this month compares with last month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're hoping to expand our advertising logic to take into account price when selecting ads.
  One advantage of this would allow us to have lower priority advertisers who buy ads at a lower rate
  but don't receive guarantees of inventory. This is helpful to make sure publishers are always showing paid ads
  while letting us balance our inventory.
  In January, we did start pitching this advertisers but haven't sold it or completed building it yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We started exploring customized ad placements on single high-value publishers.
  This is different from our traditional ad offering which shows ads across our network
  and instead focuses on buying most or all inventory for a single publisher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.

Considering the major holidays …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2 id="december-advertising-stats"&gt;December advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December was a slightly down month here at EthicalAds from our record-breaking November.
Considering the major holidays, I'll still call that a win.
The bulk of our advertising is shown during business hours and there were a lot fewer business hours in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$9,373.04&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers, a 7% decrease from November.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;89 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;5,227,541&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2020/12/ethicalads-newsletter-november-2020/"&gt;November&lt;/a&gt;, we mentioned we were holding out hope of a December increase
while mentioning that it is a historically down month for advertising.
We got pretty close, but weren't quite able to get there.
For January, in spite of the New Years holiday which results in a few days of lower traffic,
we're expecting a return to growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's amazing to look back and realize that while we've been sustaining Read the Docs with advertising for a few years now,
our wider EthicalAds network just started in July and we've been going for only six months.
In just those six months, we've grown from nothing and generated &lt;strong&gt;$42,239&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="read-the-docs-advertising-stats"&gt;Read the Docs advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2021, we wanted to begin to also report Read the Docs' advertising stats just like we're doing for the ad network.
We've reported these numbers previously in yearly &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2019-stats/"&gt;Read the Docs stats posts&lt;/a&gt;
but not on a monthly basis like we are for EthicalAds.
We will continue to break out third-party publishers just as we have been so stats will continue to be comparable month over month.
For Read the Docs in December, we achieved &lt;strong&gt;$17,656.37&lt;/strong&gt; in advertising revenue on &lt;strong&gt;8,575,795&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views.
Our goal here is to treat our own publisher, Read the Docs, as just a regular publisher as far as the ad network is concerned.
From a company perspective, we will be separating them out in terms of accounting and budget as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big things we added last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We broke out our headlines and calls to action in our ads.
  This allows publishers with custom integrations to style them differently and gives advertisers
  a convenient way to show which content should be called out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added some new reporting for advertisers to break down their performance by geography and by publisher.
  We expect that as advertisers analyze this data we are going to get requests to advertise only on specific publishers
  or on more limited geographic subsets. We are still working out exactly how to sell that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We rolled out some testimonials from advertisers and publishers on this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also delivered a &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;new prospectus for Q1 2021&lt;/a&gt;.
  The largest change was a modest price increase for targeting the US &amp;amp; Canada
  where demand continues to outstrip our supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="growing-our-team"&gt;Growing our team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month we mentioned that we'd be hoping to expand our team and that's going to start this month.
Both the Read the Docs team and the ads team are going to expand
and job postings will be up by the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For advertising, we are looking to bring on a part-time person
to help manage advertiser and publisher relationships.
At the beginning, this role will involve some customer service along with some light sales and marketing,
but the role could specialize in either direction as we continue to grow.
As I mentioned, this will start as a part-time role but we hope it will become a full-time role
by the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person will work directly with me (David) and with Eric
to make sure our publishers are getting as much money as they can
while our advertisers are getting the best results we can deliver.
Unlike many SaaS businesses, advertising is a little higher touch,
and working closely with both publishers and advertisers helps to get great results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this role sounds interesting to you, please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@ethicalads.io?subject=Ads%20relationship%20manager%20role"&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both hiring and afterward onboarding new team members are hard work and require a lot of time to do well.
We expect that this will take some time but the end result will hopefully be faster responses
to our advertisers and publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 2021, we want to treat Read the Docs as simply another publisher
and this means separating out the budget and accounting of each.
To get specific, we'll be attributing 70% of ad revenue on Read the Docs to Read the Docs itself
and count the other 30% of the revenue toward the EthicalAds network just as we do with third-party publishers.
This will let us better allocate resources to grow both sides of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another upcoming challenge in the next month is an engineering challenge around how we save data for long term archival.
While we &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/"&gt;explicitly do not track user personal data&lt;/a&gt;,
we still end up storing a large amount of data on ad impressions
in case we get issues with fraud or merely a billing dispute.
This data is close to exceeding what's reasonable to store in our transactional database and we'll need to move
into a system that can scale up a lot but it won't have real-time requirements.
While this is a fairly well-understood OLTP/OLAP kind of problem,
adding new infrastructure to our reporting is never easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to give both advertisers and publishers high level data right in their dashboard when they first login.
  These are stats like exactly how much advertising money they've spent or earned this month
  and how this month compares with last month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're hoping to expand our advertising logic to take into account price when selecting ads.
  This will allow us to assure maximum revenue for a publisher,
  but we don't want to always show a single ad on that site, either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We hope to do a beta test of a sponsorship program with a publisher,
  which is an extension of the ad network to allow for specific and customized placements on high-value publishers.
  If you're get advertisers asking you directly how to advertise on your site,
  please let us know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.

&lt;p&gt;November was a record-breaking month here at EthicalAds.
Even though we had a major US holiday and only 30 days,
we were able to increase publisher revenue by over 30% this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major driver of increased revenue was being added to the Acceptable Ads list in mid-November.
We estimate this will increase publisher revenue by 10-15%,
which explains a lot of the increase in publisher revenue.
The other major driver of revenue is adding additional publishers to the network,
which we continue to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$10,059.39&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers, breaking $10,000 for the first time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;79 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;5,484,006&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited that all of our core metrics increased this month.
We hope they will continue to increase in December,
but December is historically a low traffic month because there are more global holidays,
so we'll have to wait to find out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big things we added this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were approved for the Acceptable Ads program, which required changes to both our server and client to track traffic we can attribute to the program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added reporting for Advertisers to see what Countries and Publishers their ads are showing on the most.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added keyword reporting for Publishers. This allows them to see the performance of the various keywords they are sending on incoming traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We improved our payout workflow, which is part of the work required to lower our payout limit of $50.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added backend support for Fill Rate tracking. This allows us to understand more about how ads are being filled across keywords, geos, and publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month has felt like the ad network has really hit its stride.
The inclusion of EthicalAds on the Acceptable Ads program is a major benefit,
and has removed our longest-running difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of launching the ad network,
we have had 2 members of the team (Eric &amp;amp; David) fully focused on advertising.
As we look to grow the network,
we are hoping to expand our team by at least one person in the near future.
We have started thinking about a job description for the person we hope to bring on.
Hiring is always a challenge,
but we're excited about having growth to be able to think about supporting an additional team member.
The role we're imagining is an part-time account executive,
but someone who is interested in growing into a larger full-time business role over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this transition,
our team member Eric will be scaling back his involvement on advertising from close to 100% of time to 50%.
This will allow us to bring on an additional team member without hurting our budget too much,
until we can fully support having a team of 3 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also almost fully completed the separation of Read the Docs and EthicalAds.
In January 2021,
we are planning to fully separate the businesses in terms of our accounting and budget.
This will be the end result of the transition of Read the Docs to being a normal Publisher on EthicalAds.
It will likely take us a few months to fully work through this transition,
but it will allow us to grow advertising more quickly as we see growth in the ad network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're still hoping to adapt our ad format to &lt;a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server/issues/152"&gt;break out a headline and a call to action&lt;/a&gt;. This will standardize our ad display, along with making sure that all our advertisers have ads that work across multiple formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to give advertisers a way to change the flight targeting of their advertisements. Changing targeting generally changes the pricing, so this will require the dashboard knowing more about pricing for different targeting options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're hoping to expand our advertising logic to take into account price when selecting ads. This will allow us to assure maximum revenue for a publisher, but we don't want to always show a single ad on that site, either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We hope to do a beta test of a sponsorship program with a publisher, which is an extension of the ad network to allow for specific placements on high-value publishers.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October was another productive month on our side.
We continue to onboard new publishers and advertisers.
Growing the network each month feels great,
and we're always looking for more folks to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of development,
we've been focusing a lot on performance and reporting improvements.
This work makes sure ads load fast, which improves the user experience.
The additional reporting improvements we've made should help publishers understand the ads running on their site in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of stats, in October 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$7,580.43&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;72 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;4,571,606&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, we actually had fewer ad views this month, mostly because one of larger publishers had some integration issues.
We were able to increase revenue though with fewer ads,
which shows that our pricing increases are starting to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big things we added this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have started adding &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publishers/readthedocs/"&gt;testimonials&lt;/a&gt; to our website from our publishers and advertisers. We only have a couple completed, but will be adding more in the near future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have added reporting for publishers that show Geo and Advertiser breakdowns. These are in beta and will be enabled for everyone this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have added &lt;a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-client/pull/29/"&gt;viewport tracking&lt;/a&gt; to our ad client. This is a backstop to our Publisher Policy, confirming that ads are actually viewed for billing purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We migrated our hosting infrastructure from a Docker-based solution to a VM-based solution. This brought a 3x improvement to our average server response latency, which is now 45ms on average and 75ms at the 99th percentile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As part of this server migration we have built the capability to do &lt;a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server/pull/260/files"&gt;periodic report generation&lt;/a&gt;. We're currently updating the Geo reports each hour, but will tweak this over time as we figure out what the best options here are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also updated our ad integration on Read the Docs to use the standard ethical-ad-client. This is one of the last steps of making Read the Docs "just another publisher" and not be special. As part of this, we removed legacy ad types, and now all ads are the same image+text or image-only ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like we've managed to address most of our existing issues. Our server performance has been a nagging issue since launched, and it's very excited to have fixed it and seen quite impressive gains. Having additional infrastructure to handle periodic reporting is also another major thing we needed to do, so that we can add more reporting without impacting advertising performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a signed contract with the Acceptable Ads program, which is a major milestone. We expect this change to roll out early in November, which we forecast will bring an increase of 15% more ads shown. This will increase our publishers revenue and removes a large structural barrier that we faced to competing with other advertising networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our ongoing worries is about balancing supply and demand on the network. Especially with keyword targeting, it can be hard to maintain fill rates across our publisher network while also fully filling campaigns for our advertisers. We expect this will continue to be a difficult task forever, but we're slowly starting to understand how to balance this tension. We're also working to manage expectations on both sides, knowing that forecasting web traffic isn't an exact science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our upcoming roadmap has a few major tasks on it this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're planning to adapt our ad format to &lt;a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server/issues/152"&gt;break out a headline and a call to action&lt;/a&gt;. This will standardize our ad display, along with making sure that all our advertisers have ads that work across multiple formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're working on a Publisher Prospectus, which is similar to our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;advertiser prospectus&lt;/a&gt; -- a single place to understand what being a publisher looks like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We didn't get to it last month, but we want additional publisher &amp;amp; advertiser landing pages. We hope to build topic-specific pages to share more information for specific audiences on these pages, to go along with our testimonials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We started conversations about trademarking EthicalAds, but haven't applied for it yet. This process will take 4-6 months, but we do want to make sure we've gotten it started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We plan to take our expanded publisher reports and add similar improvements to our advertising reports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many other small tasks we'll continue to work on, along with lots of email :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for following along on our journey, and we're excited to continue to build something we can all be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="newsletter"></category><category term="community"></category></entry><entry><title>EthicalAds Newsletter - September 2020</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2020/10/ethicalads-newsletter-september-2020/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-06T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-10-06T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Eric Holscher</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2020-10-06:/blog/2020/10/ethicalads-newsletter-september-2020/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="advertising-stats"&gt;Advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September was a solid month of growth for our EthicalAds Network.
We have continued to onboard additional publishers and expand our list of advertisers.
We have also released our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;Q4 advertiser prospectus&lt;/a&gt; which has raised some of our prices given the increased interest we're seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in prices should start showing up throughout the month of September for our publishers.
Publisher revenue is the thing we care most about,
and we're happy to report that it grew &lt;strong&gt;32%&lt;/strong&gt; this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$6,966.84&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers -- so close to $7k!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;65 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;4,829,240&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued to add more features for publishers and advertisers to understand what is happening on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big things we added this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/"&gt;new website&lt;/a&gt; with an updated design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We combined our Read the Docs &amp;amp; EthicalAds landing pages and prospectus, so we only have a single source of that information now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;Q4 advertiser prospectus&lt;/a&gt; with updated topics and pricing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad client support for &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#ad-placement-reporting"&gt;placement reporting&lt;/a&gt; which allows seeing reports for specific placements on your site (eg. an ad on a list screen vs. a detail screen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad client support for &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#page-specific-keywords"&gt;per-page keywords&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current top priority continues to be getting publishers more revenue. As part of that mission we have raised prices on some of our more popular targeting options for Q4, and are expanding the topics we are targeting to better reflect out publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to have issues with ad blocking. We have had a good call with the Acceptable Ads team, and are hopeful that we will be added to the approved list in October. That will raise most of our publishers revenues by an estimated 15%, which would be huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other major thing we continue to struggle with is just the amount of work we need to do. Spinning up an entirely new ad network and brand requires a lot of various tasks, and we only have 2 people working on it mostly full-time. We are in discussion in Q4 about doing some kind of hiring, either contract or part-time with the revenue we're seeing from the ad network. We generally try to be conservative in our hiring, so it might get pushed back to next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We managed to achieve 3 of the 5 &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2020/09/ethicalads-newsletter-august-2020/#upcoming-features"&gt;features we wanted from last month&lt;/a&gt;.
We are still planning to write more blog content and ship a publisher prospectus, but they were pushed back by more pressing work this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, our roadmap this month includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A number of reporting improvements for both advertisers and publishers, to better understand their traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adapt Read the Docs to use our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;official ad client&lt;/a&gt; instead of the custom integration we have now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trademark "EthicalAds", now that we are using it as a brand. We hope we will be able to get it, otherwise we might need to consider a re-brand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional publisher &amp;amp; advertiser landing pages. We hope to build topic-specific pages to share more information for specific audiences on these pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get testimonials from our users. We have now been serving network ads for close to 3 months, so we should have some happy customers now :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the big roadmap items for us this next month, but we always have additional tasks each month like replying to email and processing payouts.
We'll continue working diligently to bring the best ad network that we can to the developer community,
and we're glad you're with us for the journey.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="newsletter"></category><category term="community"></category></entry><entry><title>EthicalAds Newsletter - August 2020</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2020/09/ethicalads-newsletter-august-2020/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-03T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-09-03T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Eric Holscher</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2020-09-03:/blog/2020/09/ethicalads-newsletter-august-2020/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're excited to share you with our first newsletter,

&lt;p&gt;August is the first full month that we've served ads on our EthicalAds network.
We're excited to already be supporting so many publishers.
Making sure developers are paid for their work is a huge part of our mission,
and revenue paid out is our most important stat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$5,375.22&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;50 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're working hard on building new features as we get more feedback from our advertisers and publishers.
It's still early days,
and we really appreciate how understanding everyone has been with any confusion in our processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big things we added this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added an explicit &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publisher-policy/"&gt;Publisher Policy&lt;/a&gt; to set expectations in our relationship with our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added an &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/faq/"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; to the EthicalAds site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We documented our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/"&gt;Ad Vision&lt;/a&gt; on the website, showing how we're different than other ad networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We improved our fraud detection mechanisms to be smarter about rate limiting ad views and detect when users are using a proxy to view the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publishers can now store payout setting in the dashboard directly. This improves our workflow for paying out publishers, hopefully making it smoother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see the latest code updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current priority is getting publishers more money. We know that we're a little bit below what some other networks are able to pay because of how new we are. We're fully focused on improving this situation, and it has happened for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our largest issue in August was getting added to the main ad block lists. We're currently working with the team at Eyeo (AdBlock Plus) to get our new ads on the Acceptable Ads list. Ad blocking removed 30% of our total traffic, which was a large impact. Being put on Acceptable Ads &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2018/05/update-on-ad-blocking-and-acceptable-ads/"&gt;got around 50% of those blocked views back&lt;/a&gt; when it happened to Read the Docs in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two other places we're working to improve this situation: raising our prices and selling more of our inventory. Since we had to scramble to get everything sold when we launched in July, we didn't have time to adjust our prices and do a full sales cycle with our advertisers. The other aspect is that a lot of our APAC inventory is unsold. For some of our publishers, this means 50% of ad views aren't currently being monetized. We generally recommend &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#customization"&gt;falling back to other content&lt;/a&gt; in these cases, if that is something you're comfortable doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a number of new things on our roadmap for September.
We'll try to share our upcoming roadmap,
so folks have an idea of what we're working on this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our large roadmap items are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve our codebase to support multiple placements for one Publisher. This will be useful for sites with multiple placements that want to track performance between them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unify the old advertising pages on Read the Docs with our new EthicalAds ones, making everything a bit clearer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve Publisher onboarding, including sharing more information about expectations in a Publisher prospectus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ship our Q4 prospectus, with some additional improvements around explaining what EthicalAds is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write more blog content around how to market to developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're always open to additional feedback and ideas on our approach,
so feel free to &lt;a href="mailto:ads@readthedocs.org"&gt;email us&lt;/a&gt; directly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="newsletter"></category><category term="community"></category></entry><entry><title>Announcing EthicalAds</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2020/08/announcing-ethicalads/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-24T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-08-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Eric Holscher</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2020-08-24:/blog/2020/08/announcing-ethicalads/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're excited to announce the release of EthicalAds,

a privacy-focused ad network for developers.
We think advertising is one of the best ways to fund open source development,
and we have first hand experience.
Ethical advertising was first created to make Read the Docs,
our own open source project,
sustainable.
We're now bringing ethical ads to other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've found that privacy preserving ads are a win for both developers and advertisers.
Advertisers are able to target developers on the sites they frequent without being blocked.
Developers trust our ads because our code is open source, and we're developers ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-background"&gt;The background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethical advertising as a concept was something we &lt;a href="https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2016/aug/31/funding-oss-marketing-money/#funding-read-the-docs"&gt;originally conceived&lt;/a&gt; for Read the Docs back in 2016.
We were an open source project trying to find sustainability,
and advertising was the answer we knew we needed.
We knew our users cared about privacy,
so we decided to build the most privacy-focused ad solution we could.
We have been working on building a sturdy business around advertising ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we started building this vision,
we were inspired to see CodeFund adopt our ideals and push them forward.
We were sad when we heard CodeFund was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/codefundio/status/1278119643937296384"&gt;shutting down&lt;/a&gt; on July 1 of this year.
We talked with Eric Berry at CodeFund,
deciding to launch our network in beta to provide a smooth transition for the people depending on that money each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've spent the last month onboarding over 50 publishers.
&lt;strong&gt;Developers have already earned more than $5,000 since we launched&lt;/strong&gt;.
We're excited to officially announce that we're open for additional publishers and advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="our-vision"&gt;Our vision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethical ads respect users while still providing value to advertisers.
The vision is pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don’t track you or sell your data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We only make money showing ads, so our interests are fully aligned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We target ads based on the content of the current page, not your past browsing history&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are as transparent in our business as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We only show high quality ads from companies that are of interest to developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we talked about in our &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/ethical-advertising-works/"&gt;2018 blog post&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;ethical advertising works&lt;/strong&gt;.
We're thrilled to be able to bring our vision of advertising to a larger audience,
and help fund open source without compromise.
Our &lt;a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server"&gt;entire ad server&lt;/a&gt; is open source,
so you can inspect how we're doing things.
We believe strongly in open source,
and we practice what we preach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="join-us"&gt;Join us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are planning to grow slowly in the near term,
making sure that everything we've built is ready for new demands.
We've already learned a number of lessons in the last month,
and we want to make sure our ads work well for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethical advertising is our vision for the future of internet advertising,
and we hope that you'll join us.
We have space for additional publishers and advertisers,
and look forward to building something meaningful with you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2019/06/ad-funding-at-read-the-docs-and-whats-next-for-ethical-advertising/"&gt;last advertising update …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a while since our
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2019/06/ad-funding-at-read-the-docs-and-whats-next-for-ethical-advertising/"&gt;last advertising update&lt;/a&gt;
and it felt like a good time to talk about what's working
with our advertising model and how things are getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-advertising-is-working-for-read-the-docs"&gt;How advertising is working for Read the Docs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2019-stats/"&gt;2019 stats post&lt;/a&gt;,
we broke out our advertising revenue which was fairly flat
year over year. The way our ad business is structured, our revenue
mostly grows with increases in traffic and Read the Docs is mature
enough that it isn't doubling in size every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, we're pleased with our steady and sustainable growth.
Read the Docs doesn't have any investors putting pressure on us for
short term growth and that has allowed us to invest in our ad business,
commercial hosting, and in our community version for the long term.
We've rolled out a huge number of improvements to all the sides of our
business in the last year and we're happy with the results. Advertising
remains the single largest source of funding for Read the Docs and one
that scales as our costs scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a real world note, Covid-19 had a short term impact on our
advertising revenue with a number of advertisers understandably pulling
back due to uncertainty in funding and the economy in general. While the
world isn't completely back to normal, we have returned some degree of
normalcy and most of these advertisers returned once there was a bit
more clarity in the broader economy and the virus' effect on the tech
industry specifically. Advertising on Read the Docs is now close to
capacity in the US, Canada, and Europe which are our largest advertising
markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="improved-targeting-for-ads"&gt;Improved targeting for ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising on Read the Docs is different from most ad networks out
there. Our ad targeting is based on the content and the reader's
geography rather than personal data about our users. Read the Docs'
authors and readers have told us that privacy is important to them.
That's great because it's important to us too! With that said, there
are great ways to target specific content niches with ads relevant to
those readers without compromising on privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, we chose a few groups of content advertisers can target where
we have enough traffic without the ads being focused on a tiny number of
projects. These niches are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data science and machine learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend web development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backend web development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DevOps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested this improved content targeting with a select group of
advertisers and the results were great. In some cases we saw click
through rates more than double. Whether the ad is to hire a developer or
to promote a service, we always want to deliver ads that are most
relevant to the documentation being served. This results in better value
to our advertisers while still respecting the privacy of our readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would your company like to get in front of more developers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell your &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/"&gt;marketing or recruiting team&lt;/a&gt; about Read the Docs and show
them how they can reach over 7 million developers who Read the Docs each
month!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="open-sourcing-our-ad-server"&gt;Open sourcing our ad server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we've wanted to do for a long time is open source the code we
use to run advertising at Read the Docs. While there's always a bit of
an incentive to keep advertising code closed so it can't be abused, our
hope is that the trust we're building with the ethical ads model can be
used by others who want to run their own ethical advertising. Read the
Docs is an open source company and it's nice to have all our code out
there. We call it the ethical ad server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ethical ad server is built to handle the kind of load Read the Docs
itself receives -- over a million hits per day -- and it delivers
advertising based only on content and geographic targeting rather than
building up user profiles from personal information. It's built from
the ground up with user privacy in mind. We're excited to share it with
you so please &lt;a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server"&gt;check out the code on
GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as we're constantly delivering improvements to Read the Docs
itself for our readers and project maintainers, we also strive to give a
better experience and better results to the companies who trust Read the
Docs as a marketing channel. I want to thank all our advertisers who
believe in our approach and continue to support us and stay tuned to
this space for more great features in the future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ethical ad network is just about ready for launch and we're
actively looking for projects to beta test the network. If you run a
developer focused website and you're looking for a way to earn money

&lt;p&gt;This post first appeared
on the &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/ad-funding-read-the-docs-whats-next/"&gt;Read the Docs company blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been three years since we first launched
&lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/ads-on-read-the-docs/"&gt;ads on Read the Docs&lt;/a&gt;
and while we gave a limited update in our
&lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2018-stats/"&gt;2018 stats&lt;/a&gt;,
we figured it was time to give an update on ethical advertising and how
it is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="advertising-without-tracking"&gt;Advertising without tracking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our ethical advertising model is still going strong.&lt;/strong&gt; We proved that
it is possible to build a business model on top of advertising without
resorting to user tracking. Unlike most other ad-supported sites, we
show advertising based on the context of the page, not by creating
behavoral profiles of large numbers of individual users. If you are
browsing documentation for a Python project, you might see a relevant ad
about Python. It's that simple and it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a slow start to the year, we expect to earn about $75,000 from
advertising in Q2. This brings our advertising revenue back to the level
before our ads were
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2018/05/ads-and-ad-blockers/"&gt;added to major ad blocking lists&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we do earn money from other sources such as our &lt;a href="https://readthedocs.com"&gt;commercial
offering&lt;/a&gt;, advertising continues to be our
largest source of revenue and has allowed us to expand our team to five
full-time people. Compared with three years ago when we were scraping
along with very little money, our community issue tracker and support
requests receive prompt responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="progress"&gt;Progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've made great progress on advertising over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We survived a major hit to revenue from ad blocking without
    resorting to cat and mouse games of changing ad layouts and APIs to
    avoid ad blockers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/page/advertising/ethical-advertising.html#community-ads"&gt;community ads
    program&lt;/a&gt;
    has been significantly expanded. We are actively running free
    community advertising promoting over ten open source projects and
    conferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we never tracked users with advertising, we put in place
    stricter &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/do-not-track/"&gt;Do Not Track&lt;/a&gt;
    privacy protections. We continue to believe that
    advertising can be well targeted without tracking users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We launched an advertising vertical to let companies
    &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2019/01/lessons-from-and-for-hiring-managers/"&gt;promote their open jobs&lt;/a&gt; to developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our advertising revenue share program tripled in size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ethical advertising approach, with no user tracking, has been key to
our sustainability and has allowed Read the Docs to continue to build
new features and give back to our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-next"&gt;What's next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have some really interesting developments coming regarding ethical
advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking to add a few more projects to our ad &lt;strong&gt;revenue share
program&lt;/strong&gt; and help more projects reach sustainability with an ethical
advertising approach. If your project on Read the Docs does 100k+
pageviews per month and you are interested in exploring a new revenue
stream, please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@readthedocs.org?subject=Ethical%20Ads%20revenue%20share"&gt;let us
know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are testing a &lt;strong&gt;new text-only ad format&lt;/strong&gt; which we will detail in a
future post. Text-only ads are something we've wanted for a while
because we believe they are less intrusive to readers but easy for
advertisers to experiment with multiple variations. So far the results
have been very promising and we are planning to roll this out more
widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;strong&gt;ethical ad network&lt;/strong&gt; is getting closer to launch. It's a shame,
but there's a critical lack of funding for open source projects that
form the building blocks of some extremely valuable software. We believe
that advertising can fill some of that gap and Read the Docs can help by
sharing some of the lessons we've learned building our own advertising.
If you know a site that might be interested in being a beta tester of a
pro-privacy ad network built specifically to help fund open source,
please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@readthedocs.org?subject=Ethical%20Ad%20Network%20beta"&gt;get in
touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thanks"&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisers always have a choice where to direct their marketing spend
and for many of them it would have been simpler to just go with the
usual behemoth advertising platforms rather than advertising with a
niche site like Read the Docs. I want to thank all our advertisers who
believe in our approach and continue to support us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="readthedocs"></category></entry><entry><title>Tips for Getting a Developer Interview</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2019/02/tips-for-getting-a-developer-interview/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-13T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-02-13T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>David Fischer</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2019-02-13:/blog/2019/02/tips-for-getting-a-developer-interview/</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post first appeared
on the &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/tips-for-getting-a-developer-interview/"&gt;Read the Docs company blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last month, the Read the Docs team conducted 30-40 customer
development interviews with hiring managers and recruiters at companies
ranging from 5-person companies to the biggest names in tech. We wanted
to learn more about hiring processes at various companies with the
ultimate goal of building &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/hiring/"&gt;a product to help companies find
developers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time, we covered some
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2019/01/lessons-from-and-for-hiring-managers/"&gt;tips for hiring managers&lt;/a&gt;
based on what companies told us they were doing. This time,
we put together &lt;strong&gt;tips for candidates looking for their next job&lt;/strong&gt; based
on insights we heard from hiring managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than covering how to crack developer interviews or how to gain
the necessary technical skills, these tips will focus on getting your
foot in the door. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making your application stand out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving your application response rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting to the interview process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="when-applying-go-deep-not-wide"&gt;When applying, go deep not wide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I don't want candidates who drive by job sites and pepper every job
they find"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a candidate, there is a temptation to play the numbers game and apply
to as many jobs as possible. Many jobs sites make it easy to apply to
many jobs quickly and this gives you that feeling that your job search
is progressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on what hiring managers told us, playing the numbers game isn't
the best approach.&lt;/strong&gt; While it is a bit of a job-seekers market,
especially for more senior talent, companies are looking people who want
to work for their company and who believe in their mission. Hiring
managers told us they want applicants who "think about the company,
then check for opportunities".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2019-facebook-job-opening.png" class="mw-100" alt="Facebook job posting with almost 300 applications in 2 weeks on just one of the job sites where this is posted."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="spend-a-little-more-time-on-your-application"&gt;Spend a little more time on your application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it takes longer to apply to a job post that requires a cover
letter or requires answers to a few questions, those are great ways to
have your application stand out relative to other applicants. You don't
want your resume to get lost in a stack of hundreds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2019/01/lessons-from-and-for-hiring-managers/"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;,
quite a few hiring managers we talked to started requiring
a cover letter or even just a couple questions that are unique to the
company in order to make their job filtering candidates easier and get
candidates who want to work there not those who just want a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the companies we talked to said when they post a job they got tons
of applicants, but that high quality, qualified applicants were still in
short supply. When 200 people apply to a job but only 20 are willing to
do a cover letter, a hiring manager can spend a lot more time per
candidate with the smaller pool. One hiring manager told us explicitly
"fewer resumes is better because there's less noise".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I know I said getting a developer job isn't a numbers game, this
doesn't strictly mean you can use these techniques to apply to 2-3 jobs
and you'll get hired. Sometimes by the time you apply, somebody is
already in the final stages of getting hired. The position may not
&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; be open anymore. Don't get discouraged in your job search.
&lt;strong&gt;Finding the right match can take time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2019-duckduckgo-application-questions.png" class="mw-100" alt="Here's some of the questions from the DuckDuckGo application process.This is your place to stand out! DuckDuckGo was **not** one of the companies we interviewed."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="make-yourself-a-referral-use-your-network"&gt;Make yourself a referral: use your network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring managers universally told us their top recruiting channel is
referrals from existing employees. As a candidate, use this knowledge to
your advantage and &lt;strong&gt;make yourself into a referral hire&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you see an acquaintance on social media post about job openings
    at their company?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does a friend or a friend of friend work at the company?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have a first connection (or a very good 2nd connection) on
    LinkedIn who works there?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all of these cases, you should contact that person before applying.
Even if the person you know isn't on the hiring team, your contact
might be able to put you in touch with the right person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most [senior] people go through their network"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a mid-level to senior candidate with 7+ years of experience, this is
even more important based on our interviews. At that stage of your
career, &lt;strong&gt;hiring managers we talked to expect a high quality candidate
to do due diligence&lt;/strong&gt; on the company and team to make sure it's a
mutual fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the exact route you take here, getting in touch with the
right people to learn more about the team, the tech stack, and the
company makes it clear that you're very interested. You're far more
likely to get a response, move on to the interview process, and
ultimately get hired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="establishing-contact-with-companies"&gt;Establishing contact with companies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning yourself into a referral is easier for a senior candidate. But
what if this is your first or second job or don't know anybody at the
company?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After referral candidates, &lt;strong&gt;the next best hiring channel in our
interviews was local meetups and engaging the local community&lt;/strong&gt;. Both
startups and established companies -- especially when they are actively
hiring -- use meetups to find talent. If you're able to meet the hiring
manager in person or establish some sort of connection, in my
experience, this raises your chances significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our interviews, another channel that mid-size and larger companies we
talked to used to recruit was to rely on their presence at conferences.
For many companies, recruiting was the primary motivator to sponsor a
conference and have a booth. As a candidate, talking to the engineers at
the booth and showing interest can ensure that your application doesn't
get lost among all the applicants they get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a smaller company, it's frequently possible to figure out exactly
who the hiring manager is from some combination of the website, hiring
posts, and LinkedIn. This is a great way to make a valuable connection
and make sure the role is a good fit. Contacting the hiring manager cold
requires a bit of finesse so make sure to be respectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Places like the monthly HackerNews Who's Hiring thread are fantastic
because they allow direct interaction with the hiring manager and many
companies list a person's direct email to inquire about a position,
learn more directly from the source, and show you're interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2019-hiring-manager-phrases.png" class="mw-100" alt="Here's some of the phrases we heard from hiring managers in
interviews."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By spending a bit more time on your application, establishing contact
with the company, and asking good questions about the work and team, you
are showing your intent and interest in the company.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to make sure the hiring manager or recruiter understands that
you're a serious candidate and you want to work there on their team.
Using these methods will improve your response rate and &lt;strong&gt;help you get
the interview&lt;/strong&gt;. By doing a one-click apply on a job site, this is
completely lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thanks"&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I'd like to thank all the hiring managers who took the time to
talk to us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="hiring"></category><category term="readthedocs"></category></entry><entry><title>Lessons From and For Hiring Managers</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2019/01/lessons-from-and-for-hiring-managers/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-30T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-01-30T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>David Fischer</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2019-01-30:/blog/2019/01/lessons-from-and-for-hiring-managers/</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post first appeared
on the &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/lessons-from-hiring-manager-interviews/"&gt;Read the Docs company blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last four weeks, the Read the Docs team did dozens of customer
development interviews with engineering hiring managers. We wanted to
learn more about hiring processes at various companies with the ultimate
goal of building a product to help companies find developers. We talked
to people looking for talent at five person companies all the way up to
the biggest names in tech. In this post, I am going to cover some of the
common things we heard from hiring managers and &lt;strong&gt;share some ways for
hiring managers to improve their company's process&lt;/strong&gt;. In our
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2019/02/tips-for-getting-a-developer-interview/"&gt;next post in this series&lt;/a&gt;,
I will have some actionable tips for job seekers based on
the same interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is a long post, I figured I'd share some of the key
takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a strategy for getting more referrals&lt;/strong&gt; whether that is
    actively asking employees or having an overly generous referral
    bonus. Referrals are probably your top source of candidates so
    figuring out how to get more will save you time and money in the
    end. Then do the same for your other best recruiting channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reach passive candidates&lt;/strong&gt;. There are a lot more passive
    candidates than active ones so have a plan to reach them. Great
    developers (especially senior ones) probably aren't actively
    looking for a new job and it's a job-seekers market. Even if
    somebody isn't considering a new job at all, the next time they do,
    you want them to think of your company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recruiting for diversity is a focus&lt;/strong&gt; for hiring managers. Put
    together a concrete plan for getting more diverse candidates and
    meeting your diversity goals. Engaging with local developer
    communities and nonprofits and encouraging referrals worked well for
    companies we talked to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get more signal in your application process&lt;/strong&gt; by adding a step
    such as a cover letter, quiz, or simply add a couple questions folks
    have to answer. Making candidates spend even one extra minute on
    their application can save you hours filtering resumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-is-read-the-docs-tackling-hiring-hasnt-that-been-done"&gt;Why is Read the Docs tackling hiring? Hasn't that been done?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we didn't initially think about Read the Docs ads for recruiting,
based on some
unexpected past successes](hiring-developers-with-readthedocs.md),
we decided to position promoted jobs as one of our main
verticals within our advertising. Rather than dash forward and create a
product, however, we started by just talking to hiring managers to
understand the hiring process better so we can best meet their needs
with something we create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the questions we asked in our interviews was how long it took to
hire their most recent developer? Specifically, we asked hiring managers
to consider how much time they and their team spent sourcing candidates,
filtering resumes, preparing for and doing phone and onsite interviews,
and anything else. Internal recruiters' time is valuable too, but we
figured the hiring manager would probably underestimate how much time
the recruiter spent since they didn't directly observe it. While
answers were all over the place, the range with the most overlap was
&lt;strong&gt;50-100 hours of engineering time to make a hire&lt;/strong&gt;. No huge revelation
here, but companies make a massive investment in hiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my days being an interviewer at Qualcomm and Amazon as well as a
smaller startup, I'd say fifty hours is on the low side for big company
but about right for a smaller company. When something costs 50+
engineering hours to do, any improvement is worth a lot of time and
money and at Read the Docs we believe we can help significantly here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="top-hiring-channels"&gt;Top hiring channels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was no big surprise to hear that &lt;strong&gt;referrals were the top hiring
channel&lt;/strong&gt;. The second best channel was a bit of a surprise with local
meetups and local communities being very high in a majority of
interviews although this was less true among the largest companies we
talked to. Companies also had some success with recruiting at
conferences, using various job sites, and proactive outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring managers shared strategies with us that they used to increase the
number of referral and community candidates they got. Two different
companies we talked to hosted multiple local meetups at their offices
and one of those hiring managers said "being plugged into the
community" was their main channel for hiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hiring manager who focused a lot on developers with security
experience talked about having "LinkedIn parties" where either a
hiring manager or internal recruiter sat with engineers on their team
one-on-one to go through their LinkedIn network. Even when he heard a
person "is great, but they'll never change jobs", that was a good
candidate to target. Security is such a high demand field, he said, that
very few great people are actively looking for a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2019-job-seeker-timeline.png" class="mw-100" alt="Job seeker timeline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reaching-people-who-arent-looking-is-critical"&gt;Reaching people who aren't looking is critical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our biggest takeaways from the interviews was that companies
wanted to reach candidates before they started actively looking. Most of
the hiring managers we talked to stressed the importance of getting in
front of passive candidates. Certainly fewer people are actively looking
for developer jobs than those who are just open to a change. A few
different reasons were given but I actually think &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/20070501/column-guest.html"&gt;Joel Spolsky had it
right&lt;/a&gt; when he
said top developers "barely ever apply for jobs at all. That's because
they already have jobs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quote isn't necessarily a slight against people who apply actively
to jobs. Virtually everyone I know in tech started their career applying
to a job. Rather, the message here is that as a developer becomes a
mid-level developer and then becomes a senior developer, they are more
likely to rely on their network to somewhat passively job seek rather
than going through the front door and simply applying on a company
website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching people who aren't actively looking is one area where Read the
Docs can really help. Companies want to reach them when they are just
thinking about a new job or perhaps passively seeking. Developers who
come to our site are actively building software, not job-seeking. Many
of them are content at their current position. For those that aren't,
this is a perfect place to showcase great companies and help Read the
Docs' visitors to find their next job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="recruiters-can-be-worth-it"&gt;Recruiters can be worth it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each interview, we asked whether the company used recruiters or
recruiting related services (eg. Hired, Triplebyte). Universally, hiring
managers brought up how expensive recruiters are, but most of the people
we talked to who had actually used recruiters in the past had a positive
impression overall. Hiring takes a ton of time, typically from senior
folks at the company. At smaller startups, that's frequently the CEO or
CTO. Even though the price is high, recruiters who help speed that
process along are worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the quote that really summed it up was from a VP of engineering
at a startup that just raised a Series B. He's trying to grow his team
by 10 developers this year (about a 50% increase). His experience hiring
his first couple developers through a 2-person boutique recruiting firm
was great and he would use them for hiring everyone "if hiring 10
people didn't mean $100k+" in fees alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: &lt;a href="https://triplebyte.com"&gt;Triplebyte&lt;/a&gt; is an advertiser
on Read the Docs. We're fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="diversity-and-inclusivity-in-hiring"&gt;Diversity and inclusivity in hiring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't ask any questions around hiring for diversity but fully six
hiring managers volunteered information on their companies' strategies
for getting more diverse candidates. This is why I love this kind of
interview where the goal is just to listen to what hiring managers say
and dig deeper when you hear something interesting. Some of the larger
companies we talked to had explicit diversity goals set at the company
level. Even among the hiring managers at smaller companies, they shared
some tactics they used to get more diverse candidates to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the companies with hard diversity goals, most of them told us that
their strategy entailed syndicating their job openings to diversity
focused jobs sites or in some cases engaging directly with relevant
interest groups. In terms of efficacy, reviews of these various jobs
boards was mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the more positive side, hiring managers cited Girl Develop It, Black
Girls Code, and PyLadies as fantastic channels for &lt;strong&gt;both increasing
candidate diversity and for high quality applicants&lt;/strong&gt;. Two companies
also talked about trying to decrease bias in their job postings using
&lt;a href="https://textio.com/"&gt;Textio&lt;/a&gt; and similar services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having multiple people mention diversity completely unprompted really
shows that this topic is becoming higher priority for companies and
hiring managers. It also shows that it if hiring for diversity is
important to your company, you need to have a plan for actually making
those goals a reality. It's worth checking whether the strategy
actually works too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="remember-sourcing-is-the-bigger-problem"&gt;Remember, sourcing is the bigger problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single hiring manager we talked to complained about the time they
spent filtering resumes from applicants. Some choice quotes I heard
included "95% of applicants weren't a fit" even after only reviewing
the resume and a hiring manager who posted to a very popular remote-only
job board told me he got "literally one thousand applications". While
I believe this is a legitimate complaint, I think &lt;a href="http://blog.alinelerner.com/building-a-product-in-the-technical-recruiting-space-read-this-first/"&gt;Aline Lerner, founder
of interviewing.io said it
best&lt;/a&gt;
when she said "Engineering hiring isn't a filtering problem. It's a
sourcing problem." The reason we heard it a lot is that filtering is a
very time-consuming task that hiring managers directly deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real problem here is that &lt;strong&gt;the number of applicants to a job post
is a vanity metric&lt;/strong&gt;. What hiring managers are looking for is qualified
applicants, which is harder to gauge without some additional work. One
of the problems here is that a lot of jobs sites make it really easy for
candidates to apply to lots of jobs. This is understandable from their
perspective as more applicants makes their platform seem more valuable.
There's no reason for a job board to put artificial barriers into the
application funnel, but hiring managers told us they want candidates who
want to work for their company not somebody who is applying to every job
out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of building product here, I think hiring managers just need a
few tweaks to get more of a signal of candidate quality and intent in
their applications. A few of the hiring managers we talked to described
how they did this. Multiple hiring managers mentioned how they required
a cover letter that answered specific questions ("why us" was the most
popular). Another hiring manager described how his hiring system just
asked a few short questions of candidates -- for example, "what is the
software project you're most proud of" -- when they applied. When a
candidate didn't do a cover letter or didn't answer the questions,
they weren't considered. The latter solution seemed like the best of
both worlds as it solves the one-click apply problem without being too
much of a barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thanks"&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to thank all the hiring managers who took time out of their
days (or in some cases evenings) to talk to us. If you're a hiring
manager or an internal company recruiter and you'd like to share your
experiences and help Read the Docs, please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@readthedocs.org?subject=Lessons+From+Hiring+Managers+Post"&gt;get in

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the Docs is probably not the first place …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post first appeared
on the &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/hiring-developers-with-readthedocs/"&gt;Read the Docs company blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the Docs is probably not the first place you think of if you are
recruiting. However, over &lt;strong&gt;7 million unique developers use Read the
Docs each month&lt;/strong&gt; from all over the world. We didn't set out to build a
better job board, but after a number of advertisers used our &lt;a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advertising/ethical-advertising.html"&gt;ethical
ads&lt;/a&gt;
for recruiting, we discovered that Read the Docs was a great place to
find developer talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hiring-with-read-the-docs-works"&gt;Hiring with Read the Docs works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers are not always actively job seeking by browsing job boards or
company careers pages. However, they are on Read the Docs reading about
the libraries and frameworks they use. Even when people aren't actively
looking for a new job, many are open to exploring new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Read the Docs, we found that developers engage with hiring ads at a
higher rate than any other kind of advertising. With hiring ads,
developers get ads that are relevant and interesting and companies reach
the folks actively using the tech they are recruiting for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2018-ctr-adtype.png" class="mw-100" alt="Click-through rate by ad type Q3 2018"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="be-specific-and-find-the-right-developers"&gt;Be specific and find the right developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for Python developers, you can configure your hiring
ad to only show on Python related documentation. You can further refine
your audience to Read the Docs visitors in specific regions. Whether you
are looking for a remote Python data scientist or a blockchain developer
in Switzerland, be as specific as possible. This ensures you don't get
unqualified candidates as well as making sure you catch the eyes of the
people you are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="set-the-right-expectations"&gt;Set the right expectations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any type of advertising, setting appropriate expectations can make
the difference between a lackluster and successful campaign. In hiring,
it is even more critical. This means making sure that your hiring ad for
a front-end JavaScript developer links directly to your JavaScript
developer job listing page where people can click "apply". Don't link
to a listing of all of your open positions unless your hiring ad sets
that expectation. Nothing is worse for the developer than clicking on a
hiring ad and not knowing what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, some things can set the wrong kind of expectation. Most
developers have seen enough hiring posts for "rockstars" and
"ninjas" to know what to expect. Be honest and upfront and you will
attract the right folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="stand-out"&gt;Stand out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers get contacted all the time by recruiters and it can be
difficult to show prospective employees why they should check out your
company. People look for all sorts of different things when seeking a
new job from working with a high-caliber team to working for a company
whose goals they agree with. You should highlight your best selling
points right on your hiring ad as early as possible. If your company
affords a fantastic work/life balance, mention that. A company in a
great location, with a beautiful office, and top of the line hardware
should definitely feature that. Focusing on your best attributes shows
you care about your developers and helps you appeal to people who care
about your products and mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you hiring?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/hiring/"&gt;Find qualified candidates&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we shared about the
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2018/05/ads-and-ad-blockers/"&gt;challenge ad blocking presented to our sustainability&lt;/a&gt;
and what we were doing about it. On May 4th, Read the Docs
was added to the &lt;a href="https://acceptableads.com/"&gt;Acceptable Ads list&lt;/a&gt;
meaning that our visitors running ad blockers who choose to allow
unintrusive advertising will see our ads again. The &lt;strong&gt;impact to our ad

&lt;dt&gt;32% of Read the Docs visitors run an ad blocker&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates around the web vary regarding what percentage of people
  run ad blockers and it varies heavily by industry. We discussed this
  figure a bit in our
  &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2018/05/ads-and-ad-blockers/"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;It took a month from application to inclusion in the list&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discovered about our inclusion in the
  &lt;a href="https://easylist.to/"&gt;EasyList&lt;/a&gt; ad blocker list within a couple
  days and immediately applied to the Acceptable Ads program. No
  changes were required of us to meet the &lt;a href="https://acceptableads.com/en/about/criteria"&gt;Acceptable Ads
  criteria&lt;/a&gt; and we also
  qualified for &lt;a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads#privacy-friendly-acceptable-ads"&gt;Acceptable Ads without third-party
  tracking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;While&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Eyeo&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;company&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;behind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;AdBlock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Plus&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="nv"&gt;derives&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;span class="nv"&gt;most&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;their&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;revenue&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;adblockplus&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;about&lt;/span&gt;#&lt;span class="nv"&gt;monetization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Acceptable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Ads&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;initiative&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;charging&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;large&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;entities&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Read&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Docs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;did&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;pay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;inclusion&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Over half of those running an ad blocker allow acceptable ads&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given our more tech-savvy and privacy-focused audience, we didn't
  know what to expect. Not every ad blocker allows acceptable ads by
  default and even then users can choose to turn them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;People running ad blockers DO click on ads&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can definitively say this is true of our audience. Our
  click-through rate did not change based on ad blocking or our
  inclusion in the acceptable ads list at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the ad views and clicks blocked by ad blockers, inclusion in the
Acceptable Ads list meant that 55-60% of our ad-blocking visitors choose
to allow our ads. This directly translated into revenue toward our
sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="building-our-ethical-ads"&gt;Building our Ethical Ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Acceptable Ads list is definitely a step in the right direction for
us. We share the goal of unintrusive advertising that respects our
audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People understand that advertising funds much of the web. As ads got
larger, more annoying, and ad networks stored more information on
millions of people, however, many people finally decided to install ad
blockers.
This is the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/the-graph/how-to-reverse-publisher-revenue-drain-c33e41bf0665"&gt;largest boycott in human
history&lt;/a&gt;
and blaming users isn't the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our experience with ad blocking and the Acceptable Ads list, it
is clear that visitors will allow advertising that doesn't disrupt user
experience and doesn't track people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are glad to have made progress toward regaining our sustaining
revenue. Read the Docs is continuing on our experiment to fund open
source infrastructure in a way that is a win/win for all parties, and we
are glad you're following along with us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="adblock"></category><category term="readthedocs"></category></entry><entry><title>Ads and Ad blockers</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2018/05/ads-and-ad-blockers/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-02T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-05-02T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>David Fischer</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2018-05-02:/blog/2018/05/ads-and-ad-blockers/</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time, we shared how
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2018/04/ethical-advertising-works/"&gt;ethical advertising works&lt;/a&gt;
to keep Read the Docs sustainable without creepy ad
targeting. This time, we will share about one of our biggest challenges
with advertising. At the beginning of April, Read the Docs was added to
one of the most popular ad block lists: the
&lt;a href="https://easylist.to/"&gt;Easylist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ad-blocker-fallout"&gt;Ad blocker fallout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2018-readthedocs-adblocker-fallout.png" class="mw-100" alt="Effect of ad blocking on Read the Docs ad views"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting added to the EasyList had a significant and immediate impact on
the bottom line at Read the Docs. Right around April 1, &lt;strong&gt;32% of our ad
views simply vanished&lt;/strong&gt;. At first, we thought we had done something
horribly wrong but then we discovered that this was due entirely to ad
blocking. Our actual traffic wasn't down at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users' browsers were simply downloading the updated EasyList which
blocked ads on Read the Docs. In terms of ad viewership, weekdays --
our busiest days and the peaks in the graph -- became more like weekends
and weekends fell off a cliff. We had always guessed what percentage of
our user base ran ad blockers. Now we know. We knew this day would come
as we became more successful but we had hoped it was a ways off
considering we weren't part of a large ad network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This directly affected our operations and staff. Our operating costs
didn't go down in any significant way, but revenue sure did.
Advertising is by far the largest source of revenue at Read the Docs and
it just dropped by about a third. This meant that we had to cut some
costs where we could and slow down some hiring plans. While Read the
Docs is not a non-profit company, all the revenue is reinvested into the
project itself, paying maintainers, and other places in the open source
ecosystem. The situation is not dire by any means, but it was certainly
disappointing that we ended up on the same list with popup advertisers
who couldn't care less about privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="all-about-ad-blockers"&gt;All about ad blockers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad blockers fulfill a legitimate need to mitigate the &lt;a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ethical-advertising.html"&gt;significant
downsides of
advertising&lt;/a&gt;
from tracking across the internet, security implications of third-party
code, and impacting the UX and performance of sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Read the Docs, we specifically didn't want those things. That's why
we built the ad network we wanted to exist with only relevant ads and no
creepy behavioral targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://pagefair.com/downloads/2017/01/PageFair-2017-Adblock-Report.pdf"&gt;2017 report from
PageFair&lt;/a&gt;
(pdf), a company that specializes in quantifying ad blocking, 11% of
global web users run an ad blocker. Considering that Read the Docs'
core audience is tech-savvy, privacy-conscious developers, it should be
no surprise that our number is higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-are-we-doing-about-it"&gt;What are we doing about it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be an uphill battle to get back to where we were in terms of
revenue and sustaining Read the Docs, here are a few things we are
working on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We applied to the &lt;a href="https://acceptableads.com/"&gt;acceptable ads&lt;/a&gt; list,
    an ad block list enabled on many ad blockers by default that enables
    some unobtrusive advertising. We are very hopeful here but it does
    take quite a bit longer to get on this list than it does to get
    blocked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nagging users into allowing ads on Read the Docs. We are envisioning
    more of a polite nag in a similar vein to
    &lt;a href="https://jsfiddle.net/"&gt;jsfiddle&lt;/a&gt; rather than an \"adblock wall\"
    which prevents usage of Read the Docs until it's allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogging and raising awareness of how ad blocking affects us and
    other open source projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we could simply change our CSS and ad API to avoid blocking since
we host our ads ourselves, we decided not to engage in a cat and mouse
game since this work would not benefit users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising funds much of the web and many people recognize that while
there are plenty of bad actors in the ad industry -- think pop-under ad
networks or ads that navigate your browser for you -- some advertising
is necessary to power the web we know and love especially when it comes
to open source software which has &lt;a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/"&gt;unique funding
challenges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: On May 4th, Read the Docs was added to the acceptable ads
list! We will collect data over the next couple weeks and have a
follow-up post on what effects this had on advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="open-source-advertising-list"&gt;Open source advertising list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Read the Docs, we also discovered that we are not the only open
source project that got our advertising blocked by ad blockers. Many
open source projects that fund themselves through advertising get
blocked and some of them don't have the resources to navigate the
acceptable ads program or understand the inner workings of ad blockers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, some web users may not want to allow all acceptable ads which
includes many ads from the big networks but we are hoping they would be
willing to accept ads that benefit their community of software
developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are launching a &lt;strong&gt;new initiative&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;a href="https://ads-for-open-source.readthedocs.io"&gt;allow advertising that
benefits open source
software&lt;/a&gt;. We encourage you
to subscribe to the this list and support open source. If you run an
open source project affected by ad blockers, we would love to help you
too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="adblock"></category><category term="readthedocs"></category></entry><entry><title>Ethical Advertising Works</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2018/04/ethical-advertising-works/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-16T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-04-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Eric Holscher</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2018-04-16:/blog/2018/04/ethical-advertising-works/</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post first appeared
on the &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/ethical-advertising-works/"&gt;Read the Docs company blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been two years since we first launched
&lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/ads-on-read-the-docs/"&gt;ads on Read the Docs&lt;/a&gt;.
We figured it was time to report on the results that we've
seen, and say thanks to those who have helped us along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-results"&gt;The Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it simply: &lt;strong&gt;Ethical Advertising works&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Q1 2018, our estimated revenue from advertising is $75,000. This is
enough to fund our small team of 4 people to work on Read the Docs
full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we started building our ethical advertising model, we didn't know
how it would work out. We didn't know much about the ad industry, and
we were doing things different than everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to report that you can build advertising that is a
win/win/win for all parties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Docs wins because we generate revenue, allowing us to
    sustain our operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advertisers win because they are able to reach our audience of
    developers, helping to grow their business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users win because their privacy is maintained, and they continue to
    have access to our service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethical advertising on Read the Docs has not been without its
challenges, which we will cover in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tracking-users-isnt-required"&gt;Tracking users isn't required&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way we've been trying to prove a simple thesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can have successful advertising without tracking our users. So much
of the trouble facing the ad industry these days is because of this
massive databases of user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been able to show that we can show ads without knowing exactly
who our users are. The content they are reading is enough to show them
targeted ads, without knowing anything about them. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not let advertisers run 3rd party code on Read the Docs. Ad
    images and javascript is all hosted by us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not provide advertisers with data dumps, except aggregated
    reports on the clicks and views their ads got.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We target our ads based only on geography and the details of the
    page being visited, not on a profile of the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're now taking a look at what we've learned, and how we might help
more infrastructure projects reach sustainability with an ethical
advertising approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="towards-an-ethical-ad-network"&gt;Towards an Ethical Ad Network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have shown that an advertising business model that respects users
can also sustain critical open source infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; We hope that we
can act as an example for other projects that depend on ads. You can
make money without giving away your users data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers have the power to shift the ad industry to respect user
privacy. We must start with our own projects, leading by example. We
need to have all the ads in the open source ecosystem respect user
privacy, and then we can start to apply pressure to other parts of the
tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We realize that not every open source project can do all the work that
we've done. We want to explore how we can build an &lt;strong&gt;Ethical Ad
Network&lt;/strong&gt;, where user data isn't sent to us, but each project doesn't
need to do ad sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ethical ad network is still in the planning phases, but if you know
a project that might be interested in being a beta tester, please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@readthedocs.org"&gt;get
in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thanks"&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to thank all of companies who have believed in our ethical ads
initiative. You can only sell something if people buy it, and I'd like
to give credit to the folks who have believed in our concept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twilio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sentry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rollbar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mongo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosted Graphite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pyup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triplebyte&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital Impact Alliance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exoscale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nginx&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odoo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircleCI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cherry Servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniregistry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OSCON&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
