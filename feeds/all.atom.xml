&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the major features we released in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rolled out our new &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#placement-style"&gt;floating ad&lt;/a&gt; type for all publishers as well as implemented its usage on Read the Docs' &lt;a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;own documentation&lt;/a&gt;. This is an opt-in feature that publishers can choose if they want a floating ad in the corner which is a pretty common setup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a stripe integration so advertisers can view previous invoices. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarified flight completion/budget remaining progress bar. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made some infrastructure improvements to better manage our load and isolate reporting from our live transactional data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest server updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-client changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="november-advertising-stats"&gt;November advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$34,679.11&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;102 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;19,103,581&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that November has a US holiday in it, 
we expected a drop in revenue and views. 
Imagine our surprise to see that our revenue actually increased in November by just over 8%!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holidays tend to slow down traffic and thus ad views/revenue across the world.
We are expecting a decrease in our key performance metrics as the year wraps up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved graphs in the ad server for advertisers and publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding view time reporting to ensure high quality views are counted as such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved keyword detection in the ad client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.

While we don't track or store personal data at EthicalAds,
running an ad network does generate a ton of data!
This is data like the publishers where certain ads perform best
or the best time of day or region to run certain ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the data was a bit hard to explore,
let alone creating and telling a compelling story from the data.
It was tied up in PostgreSQL and usually required complex joins
to get at anything meaningful.
We knew the data we were collecting could help us understand and improve our product,
but exploring our data, understanding it,
and presenting it to our advertisers, publishers, or even just ourselves was hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="business-intelligence-more-than-just-an-oxymoron"&gt;Business intelligence - more than just an oxymoron&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew we needed a tool to bridge the gap between what we had and what we wanted to know.
Ideally, it could help us with exploration, tracking our key performance indicators,
and presenting data to our advertisers, publishers, and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gave &lt;a href="https://www.metabase.com/?ref=ethicalads.io"&gt;Metabase&lt;/a&gt; a try
on a glowing recommendation from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/coderberry"&gt;Eric Berry&lt;/a&gt;,
who previously founded CodeFund, another company dedicated to ethical advertising.
Eric raved about Metabase and used it in CodeFund's product before it shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe as developers we have an implicit bias against data analysis and BI tools
or maybe it's just me and I hadn't found one I liked.
However, after trying Metabase, I was hooked.
You could explore data with or without SQL, share graphs with coworkers,
and there was an easy and secure way to embed them into or product.
Lastly, this never impacts production since our setup exclusively connects to a read-replica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage text-center"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-75" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2021-dashboard-screenshot-graphs.png" alt="A screenshot of the EthicalAds dashboard with an embedded Metabase graph"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The EthicalAds dashboard with an embedded Metabase graph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In about a week, we went from no data stack at all,
to taking visualizations from the exploration stage right into production.
It was easy to explore our data and there was a nice way to embed
graphs and charts directly into our ad server for advertisers and publishers.
It also became an invaluable way to track our business KPIs.
Metabase is the perfect tool for a small team like ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="data-we-have-yet-to-explore"&gt;Data we have yet to explore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months back, we started collecting data on how long an ad is on the screen (we call it "view time").
We think this is a really valuable metric in understanding what leads to clickthroughs
and we think that advertisers will really like it.
Advertisers routinely tell us they love all the data we share with them
and that other networks are far less transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple months, we'll be diving into this and other data.
Hopefully we'll have some great insights to share.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="graphing"></category><category term="business"></category><category term="kpis"></category></entry><entry><title>EthicalAds providing free analytics with Simple Analytics</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/11/ethicalads-providing-free-analytics-with-simple-analytics/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-11-30T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-11-30T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Eric Holscher</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2021-11-30:/blog/2021/11/ethicalads-providing-free-analytics-with-simple-analytics/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;EthicalAds is excited to be a part of the privacy-first ecosystem.

We provide our publishers a revenue stream without compromising the privacy of their users,
and we love supporting those sites moving away from any kind of tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today we're proud to announce that we've partnered with another privacy-first company,
&lt;a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/?ref=ethicalads-blog"&gt;Simple Analytics&lt;/a&gt;,
to enable you to have free privacy-first analytics on your site.&lt;/strong&gt;
They are a great alternative to Google Analytics,
and pair well with &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/alternative-to-google-ads/"&gt;EthicalAds as an alternative to Google Ads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-simple-analytics"&gt;What is Simple Analytics?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/?ref=ethicalads-blog"&gt;Simple Analytics&lt;/a&gt; is a privacy-first analytics product.
They provide similar promises to EthicalAds in terms of privacy,
and have a similar audience of developer-focused sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting from &lt;a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/our-promise"&gt;Simple Analytics' Our Promise&lt;/a&gt; page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will never collect personal information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will never sell your data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No tracking pixels on our platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because they don't sell your data,
they have to charge money to make the business work.
We thought it was a shame that price would be a barrier to making the web more private,
so we came up with a partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="funding-the-privacy-first-web"&gt;Funding the privacy-first web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking more deeply about our two different businesses, 
it seems like we could benefit each other in different ways. 
EthicalAds is about generating revenue for publishers, and Simple Analytics is a service those exact same publishers are likely buying. 
There are some pretty interesting ways to combine that when you focus on the actual sites using both of our tools. 
It really made us start thinking of ways that we could use EthicalAds to power the privacy-first revolution of website publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple Analytics wasn't able to offer a free plan.
Having a 14-day free trial allows users to try it,
but we're excited about being able to offer a permanent free tier for developer-focused sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-offer"&gt;The offer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Simple Account normally costs $19 a month for 100k page views and $59 for 1 million page views.
In this joint offer,
we would like to give away a free Simple Analytics account for everybody that starts publishing on EthicalAds.
You can also apply if you already have a Simple Analytics subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started apply to be a publisher and mention Simple Analytics in your email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publishers/#inbound-form" class="btn btn-primary lift mr-0 mr-sm-5 mb-2" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="200"&gt;
  Apply to be a publisher
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offer Terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a developer-focused site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have at least 20,000 paid ad views per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You agree with our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publisher-policy/"&gt;Publisher Policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This deal is valid until December 31st, 2021, but we will continue to pay for Simple Analytics as long as you are a publisher on EthicalAds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you sign up through this deal,
EthicalAds will share your email with Simple Analytics so they can open a free account for you.
When you don't publish anymore EthicalAds will signal Simple Analytics and your plan will convert to a paid account from that moment on.
Simple Analytics will send you a message before they convert your account to paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the ad server, we now have graphs describing key insights for advertisers and publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added new landing pages describing our open source ad network and the benefits of being a data science publisher on our network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demoed a new floating ad type on &lt;a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;Read the Docs' own documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added reporting on our ad server so we can know which reports people are engaging with.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="october-advertising-stats"&gt;October advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$32,097.44&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;102 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;19,714,391&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's really exciting about October is that although we only had
a 2.5% increase in the number of paid views from September,
in October we saw a 7.5% increase in our paid clicks!
Just over &lt;strong&gt;24,000&lt;/strong&gt; paid ads were clicked in October
As we grow, we can be more selective with our advertisers,
ensuring users on the EthicalAds network see only high quality, relevant ads
that you might actually be interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue expanding our network by onboarding new publishers.
To accomplish this, we're focusing on raising the eCPM in a variety of ways.
Firstly we raised the prices this quarter on our highest demand traffic.
Secondly, we're phasing out CPC or Cost Per Click pricing.
This ensures our publishers get paid for their views and
incentivizes our advertisers to craft high performing, attractive ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see our progress by observing the increase of our publisher payouts over time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When growing an online business, it's important to consider
where your prospects are coming from and how to convert these prospects into customers.
One key insight into this conversion comes from observing how your users interact with your site.
Without some understanding of why people click on your page, what they do while they're there,
and how this behavior corresponds to paying customers,
you're at a serious disadvantage when it comes to optimizing your site to grow your business.
Part of this process is building marketing funnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A marketing funnel is a continuous mission of getting, keeping, and growing your customer base
while using technology to meet their needs more efficiently.
However, many implementations of marketing funnels execute this mission
by collecting and hoarding personally identifiable information of individual customers.
This is by no means required by the definition nor is it even necessary
as marketing funnels have existed long before web browser trackers let alone the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="our-specific-business"&gt;Our specific business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EthicalAds is a small start-up currently focusing on expanding our userbase which comes in two segments.
We have potential advertisers who want to run new ad campaigns on our ad network and
we have potential publishers who want to host ads on their websites/platforms
in exchange for a lionshare of the generated ad revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to attract new users, we've created a number of advertiser/publisher focused ads
and advertiser/publisher specific landing pages augmenting our general referral sources
like search engines or the "Ad served Ethically" text which runs beneath every ad.
However, we previously had no good way of determining the relative success of these various approaches.
In order to prioritize our time on new ads, landing pages, or other marketing strategies,
we wanted data to guide our decision making to help us meet the needs of our customers efficiently.
In other words, we needed a marketing funnel.
Specifically, we wanted our marketing funnel to be privacy-preserving, open-source, and transparent.
In a word, Ethical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started we needed two things,  a measurement of a successful conversion and
a way to quantify which marketing methods were leading to the most conversions
while maintaining our must-haves of everything being open-source and not-personally identifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage px-md-10"&gt;
 &lt;img class="w-100" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2021-marketing-funnel-diagram.png" alt="A diagram of the EthicalAds marketing funnel"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our marketing funnel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Defining success&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there are a variety of onboarding locations that draw new users to our site
such as a tailored landing page from an ad,
a blog post linked from a third party site like HackerNews or Twitter,
or our home page from a search engine,
defining a "success" is trickier than it first seems.
There are some obvious win conditions such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An advertiser prospect fills out the "contact us" form on the Advertiser page
  which leads to a conversion (new advertiser account and paid invoice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A prospective publisher fills out the "contact us" form on the Publisher page
  which leads to a conversion (new publisher account and approved to host paid ads)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but there are also harder to quantify successes such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An interested visitor educates themself on Surveilance Advertising in our Learning Hub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A media-affiliated user fills out the generic "contact us" form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A potential advertiser or publisher navigates to a page, browses for awhile,
  and then fills out a "contact us" form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is our first marketing funnel,
we decided to focus on only the first two scenarios as "successes"
which is fairly simple since all of our contact us forms
result in the same "form submitted" page when filled out.
There are some drawbacks to this approach
such as spammy form submissions being considered successes or even
good leads for advertisers/publishers who simply didn't convert all of the way,
but opening a line of dialogue between us and the user seems to be the largest hurdle right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we defined opening a successful channel of communication as a success
even if it doesn't necessarily always result in a conversion.
Our forms contain only relevant information to an individual's request,
and is the only point in our marketing funnel where user PII is collected,
specifically their name and email address so that we may reply to their inquiry.
This alone however does not inform us as to how a user arrived on our site or how they heard about us.
For that we needed analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Open-source analytics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After surveying a variety of open source analytics solutions, we decided to use Plausible.
They have a great article on why one ought to choose &lt;a href="https://plausible.io/vs-google-analytics"&gt;Plausible over Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;.
With a simple onboarding process, they provide a light weight, open source option to monitoring inbound traffic source statistics
in a privacy-preserving, aggregated format as well as tools for measuring successful conversions
(which we defined as contact form submissions) per traffic source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All we had to do was add a distinct &lt;code&gt;?ref&lt;/code&gt; tag for each ad url
to inform Plausible to aggregate the inbounds from that url as traffic from a distinct source.
We also added a &lt;code&gt;?ref&lt;/code&gt; to the 'ads by EthicalAds' link underneath every placement
and try to include them on our content distributions as well.
This identifier is displayed to the user in the url and is in no way personally identifying.
Check the url for this article! Did you see it on twitter or hackernews?
If so, the url should have a &lt;code&gt;?ref=twitter-ethical-funnel&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;?ref=hackernews-ethical-funnel&lt;/code&gt; at the end
which will go away once you explore the site as we don't track our users in our ads or locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can A/B test new ads and landing pages for advertisers and publishers
to determine which images, formats, and copy convince users to get in touch with us.
We can also see which types of content are generating not only large quantities of traffic,
but also good resonance traffic comprised of potential advertisers or publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to determine which ads or articles are generating not only the most traffic or form submissions,
but also are generating the most successes proportionally to the amount of traffic,
enables us to determine where we should spend our time marketing for the most value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've had our funnel up and running for a little over two months now
and are looking forward to sharing some preliminary results with y'all in a follow-up blog post.

However, with many approaches to online advertising, your users could be sharing more with ad networks than you think.
You know some online advertising collects data about your visitors,
but maybe you aren't quite sure how that works or what you can do to stop it.
Are the ads you're running on your site spying on you and your users?
Here's some red flags:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Does your ad network allow advertisers to run their own scripts or load resources on your site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveillance tech:&lt;/strong&gt; Does your ad network use things like cross-site cookies, fingerprinting, or other tracking technologies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized targeting:&lt;/strong&gt; Does your ad network allow targeting that is so specific as to be nearly personal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cookie warnings:&lt;/strong&gt; Does your ad network recommend you have a cookie warning to comply with privacy regulation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data broker:&lt;/strong&gt; Does your ad network make money exclusively from ads? Or are they also selling user data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know the answers to the questions above for the ads running on your site.
Ask your ad network and see what they say.
Better yet, run a privacy scanner like &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;
on your site and see what user tracking technologies are running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="advertiser-provided-cookies-code-or-resources"&gt;Advertiser provided cookies, code, or resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the biggest things to watch out for when selecting an ad network
are advertiser provided resources, code, or cookies.
If an advertiser hosts the images or other resources for an advertisement,
they can cookie and track the users on your site across the web
(and then &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/05/how-invasive-ad-targeting-is-bad-for-journalism-and-other-high-quality-publishers/"&gt;show ads to your users more cheaply elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-100" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2021-third-party-resources.png" alt="An ad network loading third-party resources"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An ad network loading third-party resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This image shows an ad network adding a Google tracking pixel along with the ad image.
This is used for large advertisers who want to have a report of all their ads in a single Google dashboard.
This site owner may not even know that their users are being sent to a third party,
and without looking at the actual HTML it's impossible to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse than loading a tracking pixel is to run JavaScript code
provided by advertisers.
In addition to being a security nightmare,
this allows for even more exfiltration of data from your site
including some cookie values or logged-in user data displayed on your site.
While common a decade ago, thankfully allowing advertisers to run code on publisher sites
has become rarer today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With EthicalAds, we vet all our advertisers
but we still never let them run arbitrary code or cookie users on your site.
We don't save a cookie from our domains either.
Advertising can work without knowing any personal details or past sites you've visited.
With us, you don't need a &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/02/can-you-eliminate-annoying-cookie-banners-from-your-site/"&gt;cookie warning banner&lt;/a&gt;
and the ads on your site will already comply with privacy regulation like the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fingerprinting-supercookies-and-other-nefarious-tracking-tech"&gt;Fingerprinting, supercookies, and other nefarious tracking tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some common browsers like Firefox and Safari already block many third-party cookies.
This is a great step toward a more private web.
However, to "work around" a lack of cookies, some ad networks use fingerprinting
in an attempt to uniquely identify visitors for ad targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingerprinting and other tracking tech can take a few forms but some of the most common are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browser Fingerprinting:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/what-fingerprinting"&gt;Browser fingerprinting&lt;/a&gt;,
  is the process of uniquely identifying individual users based on their browser
  and other data about them like their IP address.
  These browser attributes can be anything from how the browser identifies itself
  to settings you've changed to protect your privacy.
  Customizations can make your browser appear unique rather than look like everybody else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supercookies:&lt;/strong&gt; So called &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/01/26/supercookie-protections/"&gt;"supercookies"&lt;/a&gt;
  use trackers hidden in other parts of browser like local storage, ETags, or HSTS headers.
  These are not cleared by clearing cookies
  and can potentially identify users uniquely or be used in combination with fingerprinting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNAME Cloaking:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://webkit.org/blog/11338/cname-cloaking-and-bounce-tracking-defense/"&gt;CNAME Cloaking&lt;/a&gt;
  involves a publisher setting up a subdomain for an ad tech tracker.
  This can make a third-party cookie look like a first-party cookie and gets around most tracking protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these tracking methods are easy to spot.
If you see data from your ad network in local storage, that's a red flag.
However, for some forms of fingerprinting, it happens only on the ad network's servers
and you have no way of knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EthicalAds doesn't use any fingerprinting technology.
You don't need to trust us. All our code
&amp;mdash; both the &lt;a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-client"&gt;client&lt;/a&gt; that runs on your site
and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; serving the ads &amp;mdash; is open source.
We don't track users to target them with ads because we're confident in our contextual targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="contextual-targeting-works"&gt;Contextual targeting works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all offline advertising from billboards, TV or radio spots, or ads in magazines
use contextual targeting rather than personalized targeting.
This means that a company pays to show a billboard in an area where they believe their customers live or visit.
A relevant ad will appear in a magazine about a related topic or during a TV show about a similar topic
or that has the right audience.
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/"&gt;Our vision&lt;/a&gt; for advertising is built on this and applies it to the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising doesn't need to track your users to work well both for your site and for advertisers.
Our ads are targeted only on the content of the page where the ad will be displayed and very rough geography.

&lt;li&gt;Our new &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;prospectus&lt;/a&gt; came out. 
  We raised the geo-prices in the US and EU in order to combat our overbooking issue and earn more money for our publishers.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added a read replica database which improves the performance of our dashboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the advertiser dashboard, when you copy an advertisement to a new flight, they're ordered by the age of the ad, newest first. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now when a 'Contact Us' form is filled out, we ask if they would like to start receiving our newsletter. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="september-advertising-stats"&gt;September advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$31,380.78&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;103 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;19,238,786&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September was our best month to date in terms of paid views and revenue! 
We had a 12% increase in September's revenue from August which was a 15% increase from July before that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of our revenue improvements were due to price increases that went into effect over the last quarter
and partially due to selling more of our harder to sell inventory.
Our effective cost per thousand impressions (eCPM) has improved across the board. 
The US &amp;amp; Canada eCPM has improved from $2.87 in June to $2.93 in September, 
our APAC eCPM went from $0.56 in June to $0.68 in September, 
and our EU eCPM went all the way from $2.40 to $2.92 in September.
This means more money in the pockets of our publishers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still have the fortunate problem of being overbooked in the US and EU especially,
which has resulted in many of our on-going campaigns falling behind schedule.
We've adjusted our roadmap priorities to focus more heavily on publisher acquisition.
We are also looking into additional ways of managing pricing,
so that we are able to better determine priority of ads across time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New landing pages describing our open source ad network and the benefits of being a data science publisher on our network. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding graphs to our advertising dashboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure improvements to better manage our load and isolate reporting from our live transactional data.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Giving the publisher the ability to turn off/on their own payouts, managing their own payment schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the ad client, we shrunk the size of the client by about 40% which results in faster load times.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;18,521,177&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world marking another increase over July's ~14 million views.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started a number of new global campaigns this month which boosted our paid view count significantly,
although we are still limited by publishers across the network. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still have the fortunate problem of being overbooked in the US and EU especially,

In order to honor our existing advertising flights, we're scheduling out new flights to start in October.
We're also releasing our new prospectus in October, raising the price of these overbooked geos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our ad server, we added &lt;code&gt;noopener&lt;/code&gt; to our ad links as a security precaution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our ad server now raises a warning on link redirects and errors when advertisers are creating an ad, to make sure it isn't an error in the URL. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also in our ad server, we created actions to allow our staff to handle
  the creation and customization of new advertising flights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our website, we created our first iteration of an &lt;strong&gt;ethical&lt;/strong&gt; marketing funnel
  by implementing a transparent, human-readable first-person cookie,
  running the open-source, privacy-friendly &lt;a href="https://plausible.io/vs-google-analytics"&gt;Plausible analytics&lt;/a&gt;,
  and creating our first ad-specific landing page for &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publishers/topics/python/"&gt;prospective Python publishers&lt;/a&gt;.
  Lookout for a blog post on how we did it, coming out soon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also on our website, we launched our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/07/ethicalads-publisher-referral-offer-july-2021/"&gt;Publisher Referral Offer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$23,981.08&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;105 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;16,257,531&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July we undertook an effort to ensure the high quality of our network,
we removed a number of under-performing publishers 
and onboardeded some new publishers, though we continue to &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/07/ethicalads-publisher-referral-offer-july-2021/"&gt;look for more&lt;/a&gt;!
We also launched a few globally-targeted ad-buys which resulted in a sizable increase of views from June's ~14.6 million paid views. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still verging on max capacity with regards to ad inventory specifically in the US and EU.
We focused our efforts this month are marketing in order to attract new publishers.
We rolled out our new marketing funnel and were even featured on
&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27987650"&gt;HackerNews&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27975685"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;.
Unfortunately, determining the success of these new endeavors
takes time as we don't want to change too many variables at once,
lest we not know which avenues had the greatest impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing a view time metric for our ads to ensure a fair system for counting valid views
  as well as provide a metric for publisher quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Releasing our Surveillance Advertising informational page to the Learning Hub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlighting our 10% discount on ad buys over $3000 in the flight report page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating our Publisher Guide with new examples of superior placements
  and some explanation as to why they are so desirable.&lt;/li&gt;

and our journey in building a business around the intersection of the two.
This post is going to go under the hood and discuss some of the technology and scaling challenges
we ran into with our ad server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage"&gt;
 &lt;img class="w-100" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2021-adserver-performance-throughput.png" alt="Ethical ad server throughput on a normal week"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Normal throughput of our ad server peaks at about 3,500 requests per minute which is ~60 requests per second. The small drops are nights and the big ones are weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="breaking-out-the-ad-server"&gt;Breaking out the ad server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before late 2019, ads on Read the Docs were served by a Django app that was actually part of the Read the Docs code line.
We knew we wanted to break it out into a separate service to prepare for launching our ad network.
However, the process was a bit tricky since we knew that on day one this new server
would need to handle around 20-30 requests per second and traffic spikes could take that number to 60 or higher.
To prepare for this, we relentlessly focused on our app performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, Python and Django are not considered the most performant language and framework.
We didn't want to do a from-scratch rewrite, however, in a more performant language.
There was also a strong desire to use a similar setup to Read the Docs
as that's what our small team (of 5 at that time) knew well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve the performance, we actually spent quite a bit of time digging through New Relic traces
and going over each Postgres query in &lt;a href="https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;Django Debug Toolbar&lt;/a&gt;.
For an ad server like ours, just a few different APIs -- like requesting an ad and viewing an ad --
account for almost all transactions.
We even have unit tests to ensure the number of database queries doesn't change in these APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were pretty confident that the ad server was ready to go live code-wise,
we did some load testing to make sure it could handle the traffic.
There were definitely a few false starts during the initial rollout
and in the end we decided to put it through a full load test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="load-testing-our-ad-server"&gt;Load testing our ad server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure we could handle the load we knew we were going to see once we rolled out the ad server,
we did a staging deployment to Heroku and to &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/"&gt;Azure's AppService&lt;/a&gt;
to compare how they performed.
This wasn't particularly complex given that this app was structured to be cloud agnostic from the start.
After that, we used &lt;a href="https://github.com/JoeDog/siege"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt; to test the deployment
at various loads up to 100 ad requests per second.
These were real requests exactly like we'd see in production and we wanted to see how staging would cope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Heroku (4 Standard-2x dynos, 10 Gunicorn processes each, ~$200/mo)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty standard Heroku setup to handle a performance heavy application.
We tested it at various thoughputs but it was able to handle 100 requests per second without dropping requests.
However, we did see our 99th percentile performance (p99) creep up to the 550-600ms range which is pretty bad.
On Heroku, 100 concurrent requests would also bump us into some pricier Redis and Postgres setups
to handle over 100 connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Heroku (10 Standard-2x dynos, 10 Gunicorn processes each, ~$500/mo)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we more than doubled the provisioning.
This setup performed much better although it didn't seem to be exactly linearly better which was a little odd.
Our p99 was closer to 350ms in a 100 requests per second setup and it didn't drop any requests.
The median performance (p50) stayed about the same at 80-90ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;AppService (4 Premium P1s, 10 Gunicorn processes each, ~$300/mo)&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a pretty comparable setup in Azure to the Heroku setups.
We ran the exact same code and the configuration was as close as possible.
We tested various numbers of instances and the performance scaled very linearly with instance count.
Performance was quite a bit better with a p50 of ~75ms and the p99 was drastically improved to ~200ms.
Even in longer and larger tests (with more instances in some cases),
we saw much better performance on AppService than on Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result of the load tests was that we launched the ad server on AppService
where got predictable performance and the right bang for the buck.
Heroku definitely wins in ease of deployment and it has a lot of advantages and flexibility.
However, for this kind of application where performance and predictability were critical,
AppService was the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage"&gt;
 &lt;img class="w-100" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2021-adserver-performance-percentile.png" alt="Normal real-world performance from New Relic"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;With our current performance over a normal week, New Relic reports our p50 at 58ms and the p99 at 105ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="performance-today"&gt;Performance today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months after rolling things out to production we encountered some issues with AppService.
In response, we switched to autoscaled &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview"&gt;VM scaling sets&lt;/a&gt;.
Using the same siege setup, we were able to show that VM scaling sets
(which we also use on Read the Docs) not only scaled better
but also cut about 15ms off of our p50.
We aren't sure why they're faster but we assume it's some overhead with AppService and containerization.
That doesn't sound like much but it's actually quite a lot when
you consider we didn't change the database or ad server code whatsoever.
Except under unusual load, we're usually scaled to about 3-4 instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've done a few further optimizations like reducing cache requests to Redis
(the fastest request is the one you don't have to make).
Currently, about 20ms of a normal request is taken in Python
while the remainder is consumed in Postgres and Redis.
This shows the upper bound of any framework or language optimizations.
Django and Python may be slow but at most replacing them could shave 10-15ms off our performance.
Improvements on our infrastructure or how we handle data would yield better results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="postimage"&gt;
 &lt;img class="w-100" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2021-adserver-performance-breakdown.png" alt="Performance breakdown of the ad server"&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A little over half our server time is spent in Postgres while Python is just under half&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="our-next-scaling-challenge"&gt;Our next scaling challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next big scaling challenge is how to have good performance on different continents.
We can optimize server performance all we want but Europe and Asia are 80-100ms worse due purely to latency.
Currently, our source of truth is what is in our Postgres database
and reworking our solution to actually process ad requests at the edge will be a big change.
This will be more complex than CDN edge caching since most of our requests involve DB writes.
Multi-writer scenarios for databases are never easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the major features we added in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our ad server, we updated the weighting algorithm to slightly bias showing CPC ads on higher CTR publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our ad server now tracks historical changes to ad campaigns,
  allowing us to track changes over time to better understand performance. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also in our ad server, we added actions to allow our staff to handle
  adding new publishers and processing publisher payouts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our website, we updated our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;prospectus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/#pricing"&gt;pricing&lt;/a&gt; information for Q3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also recently expanded our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publisher-guide/"&gt;Publisher Guide&lt;/a&gt; on the Learning Hub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="june-advertising-stats"&gt;June advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June was a slight improvement over May for advertising
as we had some new ad buys start as well as a couple new publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$24,362.13&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.
  Of this, $12,696.56 was to third-party publishers, with the rest to Read the Docs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;106 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with at least one paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;14,574,934&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminder, we are actively working to onboard
new, high quality publishers, which will expand our ad inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still verging on max capacity with regards to ad inventory.
We slightly raised our prices in Q3 in our high demand areas to address this. 
Also, we rolled out a number of new house ads across the network to find new publishers.
Unfortunately, determining the success of these new ads is difficult
without using common third-party tools that track users.
We are looking into privacy preserving analytics options for our website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a staff interface for customizing ad flights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are still not sure of the best way to implement referrals.
  We might try something simple to see if it works, and build on it if we find that it works. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View time for ads will allow us to ensure a fair system for counting valid views
  as well as provide a metric for publisher quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Also in our ad server, we added actions to allow our staff to better assist in

&lt;li&gt;On our website, we updated and streamlined our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/#community-ads"&gt;Community Ad&lt;/a&gt; information.
  Now open source community projects can apply to have their ads run for free
  by like-minded publishers when a paid ad is not available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also recently launched our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/learning-hub/"&gt;Learning Hub&lt;/a&gt;.
  Your one stop shop resource for information on EthicalAds, our audience, and
  what makes a good advertisement. More on that later.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="may-advertising-stats"&gt;May advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May was a great month for advertising as we had some new ad buys start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$23,495.17&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.
  Of this, $11,719.57 was to third-party publishers, with the rest to Read the Docs.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;14,659,563&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, we undertook an effort to increase the performance of publishers
with the lowest Click Through Rates.
In some cases, we were able to increase performance
while in others, we agreed to part ways.
As we approach our ad capacity, we are actively working to onboard
new, high quality publishers, which will expand our ad inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="learning-hub"&gt;Learning Hub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discover more about EthicalAds right from the navigation bar!
Our new &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/learning-hub/"&gt;Learning Hub&lt;/a&gt; collects information regarding
who we are, our vision for the future of advertising,
and statistics on the make-up of our audience. It also contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advertiser's Guide which details how to craft a great advertisement
  for &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; audience including insights into what has worked well in the past.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are on the verge of max capacity with regards to ad inventory.
With our processes becoming more standardized, allowing new staff to handle day to day operations,
we are now ready to focus on growing the network.
Marketing and growth is a challenge for any small business.
Thankfully, an advertising network gets better as it grows bigger.
More advertisers means more money for publishers and
more publishers means a larger pool of specific topics for advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most recent changes to targeting will be highlighted in the advertiser's dashboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are designing a referral system for our current publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad Click prioritization will be coming to our network.
  Advertisers who pay per click will be matched with
  publishers who have high click through rates.&lt;/li&gt;

you’d buy ad space on a billboard where those people are likely to see it
or buy an ad spot in a newspaper section that your target market reads.
On the internet before hyper-targeted advertising,
this meant finding an online publication for your product
or buying up specific, relevant terms on search engines.
If you plan to introduce a new line of cat food?
You run an ad on &lt;a href="https://moderncat.com"&gt;ModernCat.com&lt;/a&gt;
or you pay to take the top search engine result for "cat food".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rise of ad tech powered by personal data collection,
advertisers can reach cat lovers (or any targeted group)
by paying ad tech companies to show their ads wherever the audience goes.
Maybe you pay top dollar for ModernCat.com for a little while,
but after you've got cookies to track their visitors onto other sites,
you can reach the same folks on lower quality channels more cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-impression-commoditization-means-to-publishers"&gt;What impression commoditization means to publishers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of this intrusive targeting and tracking people across sites is a race to the bottom.
Advertising dollars have moved away from publications with well researched content written by knowledgeable authors
to low quality SEO optimized sites with re-purposed material developed to maximize paid ad impressions.
While there are a lot of reasons for the fall of newspapers, this dynamic shift is a major factor.
Instead of spending money on investigative reporters,
it makes more economic sense to churn out clickbait that rephrases research done elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, all impressions are the same from an ad tech perspective.
It doesn't matter if ads appear on the paper of record or on a clickbait site
if they reach a similar audience.
Ad views have become a commodity.
For most ad-funded sites including many newspapers,
the race for views comes at the cost of sacrificing quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-publishers-can-do-about-it"&gt;What publishers can do about it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers can take back their audience and advertising revenue in a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut off ad tech surveillance technology.&lt;/strong&gt;
  Ad tech is driven by personal data which, with some exceptions, is collected from individual publishers sites
  through the use of third-party cookies, fingerprinting, and other tracking technologies.
  Publishers should eliminate or severely restrict what ad tech can run on their site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop providing ad space for tracking companies to show ads.&lt;/strong&gt;
  Where it isn't possible to restrict the ad network in terms of tracking,
  remove ads that track users completely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean giving up your ad revenue, though.
While there seems to be unlimited ad space online there is a very limited amount of quality ad space.
Larger publishers can work directly with advertisers to privately place ads often driving up their own revenue
&lt;a href="https://open.nytimes.com/to-serve-better-ads-we-built-our-own-data-program-c5e039bf247b"&gt;as the New York Times did&lt;/a&gt;.
For publishers that are too small or unable to hire a sales force,
they can find an ad network that will place ads without sacrificing user privacy
or siphoning off their audience's data for the ad network's gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving small and mid-size publishers a way to monetize their audience without giving up their privacy
is the reason we built the EthicalAds network.
There are lots of developer-focused sites that are too small to sell ads directly.
If you're looking for an ad network that won't compromise your audience,
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publishers/"&gt;join EthicalAds&lt;/a&gt; and help preserve privacy on the web!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to backpeddle. "No one is personally listening in to your conversations, grandma, it was an analogy." Explaining my new job to my grandmother was not going well. Bemoaning the evils of modern Ad Tech by highlighting how coporations were tracking her around the web &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; not have been the wisest approach. Knowing that my grandmother is an avid online shopper, I tried another tact, "You know how when you're reading the news, you get those big flashy banners for stuff you already looked at and decided to not buy?"  "Oh, I see those all of the time!" Progress. "Yeah! They're big and flashy and purposefully annoying in order to distract you? My company is an advertising network that connects developer-focused publishers," "Developers?" Right, to my grandmother a developer worked in real estate. "Coders, like me - we connect techy publishers with relevant, respectful ads for products that actually work. And we do it without storing any information about you or what you were looking at!" My enthusiasm was met with silence and I was worried that I'd lost her again, "Grandma?" Hesitantly she spoke, "But does &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; work? Honey, my dad always said the louder the soap salesman, the more soap he'll sell." She then told me a story of her father, my great-grandfather, who was in fact a soap salesman himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One morning in the summer of 1938, my great-grandfather was out for a walk by the river early and he noticed people washing their clothing in the river without bar soap. He decided then and there to tap that market and would go down on his walk every morning with a box full of soap to sell. Selling by the river early in the morning before the factory opened worked incredibly well, until other soap vendors realized the simplistic brilliance of his approach. Soon my great-grandfather was in competition and learned that he had to get creative with drawing attention. My grandmother cautioned me, "The loud, charismatic vendor inevitably sells more soap than the quiet, reserved one." Oy. This is the mindset that has been shaping advertising for the past 100 years; this is how we have arrived at the current state of the internet, almost unbrowsable without an ad-blocker thanks to pop-ups, banner ads, and booby-trapped x's. At least, we were getting somewhere. She definitely understood that our publishers were our river and that we are the soap-sellers, but how do I explain ad-blockers? So I asked my grandma "What if yelling was out-lawed?" "Make yelling illegal?" she repeated incredulously. I told her a little bit about how ad-blockers worked, mildly surprised that I hadn't already set her up with one when I set up her laptop, and explained that EthicalAds gets around ad-blockers &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; our ads are quiet and reserved. "Hmmm..."  After careful consideration, she made up her mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You have your foot in the door, not a seat at the table. Have you considered making your ads &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;~beautiful~&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm Ra Cohen: data scientist, people person, and the latest addition to the EthicalAds team. Using pretty pictures, willful words, and data science, I'm on a mission to help people reach their audience and tell their story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pretty-pictures"&gt;Pretty Pictures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a data scientist, I know just how much impact framing and perspective can have on impressions. A graph zoomed in around all of the action will tell a very different, more turbulent story than the same data presented on a graph with its origin at 0. My design philosophy draws from the Data-Ink ratio principle. The less ink you can use over all, the better, and that ink which you do use should be fundamental to conveying your data. I'm excited to apply my eye for artistry not only in illuminating the beauty of data, but also to illustrate the beauty of advertising. Beauty captures our attention like nothing else, stirring us to action with the promise of a better tomorrow. Is that not also the goal of advertising? To reincarnate Helen of Troy into the image that launches a thousand clicks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A picture may be worth a thousand words, but context can make it worth a million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="willful-words"&gt;Willful Words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good writing is the intersection of clarity and purpose. Conveying information and motivating one's audience are best accomplished by the &lt;strong&gt;willful word&lt;/strong&gt;, a word mindfully chosen to perform work and left free of clutter. Due to the brevity of advertising, the creatively willful word thrives. The attention of your reader is valuable and respected. We are happy to assist in the creation of your advertising copy upon request. Your time is valuable too, so I endeavor to keep all emails to the point as I assist with advertiser and publisher account management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also happy to schedule a phone call to discuss your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="data-science"&gt;Data Science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all science, the first step to data science is to ask a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Are you a publisher who wants help understanding how our latest updates affected your profits? Or do you want to compare your data over a few ad placement spots in order to maximise your click through rates? Perhaps you're an advertiser who wants to know how changing your targeting will affect your total number of impressions. Send us an email; I breathe data! In school, I took courses in our data science graduate program to fulfil my undergrad computer science requirements. After graduation, I went to work as a research scientsit for two years where I built visualization dashboard prototypes for DARPA. I'm glad to now be working at EthicalAds, shaping the future of advertising for a more respectful, beautiful future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we are thrilled to have you along with us on our journey to build an ethical ad network.

&lt;p&gt;Here's the major features we added in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our ad client, we made some improvements …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the major features we added in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our ad client, we made some improvements to our contextual targeting.
  We now parse pages where ads will appear to discover their main topics in order to better target them
  with the right kind of ad. As always, we focus on content and contextual targeting,
  not targeting ads based on learning about users or about past actions users have taken.
  While we've only taken the first steps here, the end result is greatly improved targeting
  and the ability to target more niches with high quality ads which is one of the keys to good ad performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our ad server, we made a number of small improvements for our advertisers to improve their workflows
  and better allow them to make decisions to improve ad performance.
  This included better ways to compare past performance to current performance and the ability to easily re-use
  past high-performing ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also took the first steps toward prioritizing higher performing and higher priced ads.
  We believe this is the right step to ensure that publishers are getting the most they can from their ad spots,
  while giving advertisers incentives to produce high quality ads.
  While we expect this will drive a slight increase in publisher revenue, so far the impact has been very small.
  We are continuing to make improvements to ad prioritization in May and beyond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest server updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="april-advertising-stats"&gt;April advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April was an interesting month for advertising
as we had rolled out some of our contextual targeting changes and had some new ad buys start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$23,831.85&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.
  Of this, $12,154.71 was to third-party publishers, with the rest to Read the Docs.
  While not a surprise, this was an all-time record for our third-party publishers!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;101 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;17,507,857&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.
  The biggest reason for a large increase in ad views was that we received a couple ad buys
  with nearly global targeting.
  While these don't always bring in lots of revenue as global targeting isn't very expensive,
  they can have a big impact on the total number of ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, May is looking to continue the gains that we made in April
but if we are able to close a few ad buys we have in the pipeline,
that could put our revenue over the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-hire"&gt;New hire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the hiring front, we were able to find a talented person to help with advertiser and publisher account management.
Ra Cohen brings a background in machine learning and a passion for connecting with people
to our small corner of the ads industry.
Expect a full introduction in the next couple weeks.
We are lucky to have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the hiring complete, onboarding will probably be the trickiest part in the immediate future.
Bringing on a new person is always hard when it's done well and we expect this won't be any different.
This will involve making a lot of processes we have more regular but in the long term
we expect this will lead to better outcomes and faster response times for our publishers and advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the improvements we've been able to make on ad prioritization,
  we will be rolling out the ability to have "flex advertisers".
  This will give advertisers who opt-in to this program lower prices but without guaranteed inventory.
  This helps us ensure that as many ad slots have paid ads for our publishers while letting us balance our inventory.
  In the &lt;em&gt;much longer&lt;/em&gt; term, we see this as a first-step toward a form of bidding for ads
  that will be familiar to advertisers used to the big ad networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are building improvements into both our ad client and ad server to improve our contextual targeting.
  We believe that good contextual targeting is one of the keys to our network's success.
  This lets advertisers reach the audience they want as well as possible without creepy targeting
  and without requiring publishers to do the work of categorizing all their content.
  By automatically categorizing content, we'll have more inventory for more niches that advertisers want to target.
  For publishers, this is also a win because better targeted ads cost more and bring in more revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.

&lt;p&gt;March was another record month ever for advertising

&lt;p&gt;March was another record month ever for advertising
although &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/03/ethicalads-newsletter-february-2021/"&gt;February&lt;/a&gt; was better per day due to being a shorter month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$23,994.57&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers, another record but only 1% over February.
  Of this, $10,711.54 was to third-party publishers, with the rest to Read the Docs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;104 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;14,768,103&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expected revenue to publishers other than Read the Docs to exceed our own revenue in March and that didn't happen.
However, that looks nearly certain in April due to some larger advertisers shifting toward the wider ad network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the major features we added in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the business side, we released a &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/press/"&gt;media kit&lt;/a&gt;
  to help us get more traction and be part of the privacy conversation around advertising
  which is an important goal and requires constant effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our ad server, we made a number of reporting improvements for both publishers and advertisers.
  These included showing more data, giving more high level overviews of data, and speeding up our existing reports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We started automatically including the publisher name when redirecting to an advertiser's site.
  The advertising industry could use a bit of transparency
  and advertisers sometimes don't know where their ads are being shown.
  Our aim is to be as transparent as possible and give advertisers the ability to make more informed decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made a small tweak to our ad display algorithm when the same person requests multiple ads within a few seconds.
  We now cache the ad and show the exact same ad and only bill advertisers a single impression for it.
  For most publishers, this made almost no difference but for some this resulted in fewer ad views being counted
  and therefore less revenue.
  We believe this is more fair to advertisers and incentivizes publishers to have good ad placements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our infrastructure, we've solved most of our performance/IO problems from the previous month.
  We are archiving data out of our transactional database on a regular basis after it is processed
  to help with performance.
  Longer term, we will probably use a separate reporting database for both performance
  but for now, we're keeping it simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest server updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still aim to hire an &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/jobs/account-manager-part-time/"&gt;account manager&lt;/a&gt;
to help manage advertiser and publisher relationships.
Initially, we were looking for somebody to work around 20 hours per week
but we've added a bit more range -- 20 to 32 hours -- to give the role a bit more flexibility.
We're looking for somebody who is early in their career or returning to their previous career
and wants to ease into it with a flexible position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring is always hard and takes a lot of time to do well.
If this role sounds interesting to you,
please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@ethicalads.io?subject=Ads%20account%20manager%20role"&gt;get in touch with any questions&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/jobs/account-manager-part-time/"&gt;apply&lt;/a&gt;!
In addition, Read the Docs is hiring a &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/job-frontend/"&gt;frontend developer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beginning in April, we're going to expand our advertising logic to take into account an ad's price and performance
  when choosing which ad to show.
  One advertiser has agreed to be a flex advertiser with part of their ad buys in Q2
  which will give them lower prices but not guaranteed inventory and this feature was a necessary step.
  This helps us ensure that as many ad slots have paid ads for our publishers while letting us balance our inventory.
  Initially, we expect this will drive a slight increase in revenue to publishers as we prioritize higher priced ads.
  Longer term, this aligns incentives to have better performing ads for advertisers and better performing placements on publisher sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are building improvements into both our ad client and ad server to improve our contextual targeting.
  We believe that good contextual targeting is one of the keys to our network's success.
  This lets advertisers reach the audience they want as well as possible without creepy targeting
  and without requiring publishers to do the work of categorizing all their content.
  By automatically categorizing content, we'll have more inventory for more niches that advertisers want to target.
  For publishers, this is also a win because better targeted ads cost more and bring in more revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the last few months, we mentioned supporting custom ad formats as a sort of sponsorship.
  This has been deprioritized for now in favor of other improvements.
  However, we did get some interest on the sponsorship side.
  Some larger sites expressed interest in using our ad server to manage their own internal sponsorships
  while using our management interface and reporting.
  Depending on demand, we may build some more features around that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.

that after they phase out third-party cookies in Chrome next year,
they "will not build alternate identifiers to track individuals as they browse across the web."
On the surface, this looks like a win for a more private web.
This would put Chrome, the most popular browser, on a similar footing to Safari and Firefox
which block most third-party tracking out of the box.
As more details started to come out about Google's vision, however,
things started to get a bit murkier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="googles-vision-for-the-future-of-ads"&gt;Google's vision for the future of ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Google's vision, ads targeted to users' interests aren't going away but are merely changing.
Built on Google's &lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox"&gt;Privacy Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;,
which is part of the open source engine behind Chrome,
Google promises these changes will create a more private web
while keeping targeted advertising just as effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Advances in aggregation, anonymization, on-device processing and other privacy-preserving technologies offer a clear path to replacing individual identifiers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Temkin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Director of Product Management, Ads Privacy and Trust at Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of ad networks or ad tech companies keeping and storing data on users to target them with ads,
Google is testing an approach they call &lt;a href="https://github.com/WICG/floc"&gt;Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC)&lt;/a&gt;
which will have your browser learn about the things you like so you can be targeted with ads.
Likewise, for personalized ads, they have another approach called &lt;a href="https://github.com/WICG/turtledove"&gt;Turtledove&lt;/a&gt;.
These will expose new browser APIs that advertisers and ad networks can use to target ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake,
while these changes have some privacy benefits, they also are about control.
Google's vision for ads put them at the center of the ads ecosystem.
Google controls the browser you're probably using right now
and they'll control how these new tools and APIs like FLoC can be used for advertising.
In addition, Google has a first-party relationship with you and they don't need third-party cookies.
They can continue to use the emails you receive in Gmail,
the places you get directions to in Google Maps, the videos you watch on YouTube,
and the things you search for on Google to target you with ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) called FLoC a "terrible idea"&lt;/a&gt;.
They say it will help ad tech companies fingerprint users
so they can uniquely identify them more easily.
Any site which supports logging in could easily request FLoC data and add it to users' data profiles,
connecting that with the existing personal information they have on this user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-ad-tech-companies-are-doing-about-it"&gt;What ad tech companies are doing about it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response from the ad tech side of the industry ranges
depending on where the company sits in the ecosystem.
Even if Google's vision doesn't become a reality
-- we expect some of it will and some of it won't --
the end of third-party cookies won't be the death knell for ad tech,
behavioral targeting, or personalized ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of alternatives to cookies for tracking users across the web which are more invasive.
For many ad tech players, third-party cookies going away won't affect them at all because they use these methods of tracking.
The list of the techniques used to circumvent cookie restrictions
is potentially endless but here are some common techniques:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fingerprinting:&lt;/strong&gt; As the EFF called out, fingerprinting,
  or the process of uniquely identifying individual users based on their browser
  and other data about them like their IP address is common practice in the ad tech space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supercookies:&lt;/strong&gt; So called &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/01/26/supercookie-protections/"&gt;"supercookies"&lt;/a&gt;
  use trackers hidden in other parts of browser like ETags or HSTS headers.
  These are not cleared by clearing cookies and can potentially identify users uniquely or be used with fingerprinting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNAME Cloaking:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://webkit.org/blog/11338/cname-cloaking-and-bounce-tracking-defense/"&gt;CNAME Cloaking&lt;/a&gt;
  involves a publisher setting up a subdomain for an ad tech tracker so it appears as a first-party domain for cookie purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisers and ad tech companies are also leery of Google having too much control.
With states like California and Virginia adopting privacy legislation,
they know the privacy landscape is changing and some of them are trying to get in front of it with their own proposals.
The Trade Desk, an ad tech company,
has an alternative approach they call &lt;a href="https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/about-us/industry-initiatives/unified-id-solution-2-0"&gt;Unified ID 2.0&lt;/a&gt;.
This will only work for sites and apps that support logins
since it operates off of hashed email addresses, but once logged in,
users can be targeted with personalized ads.
While this isn't an approach we want to see become the norm, it is at least upfront and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, some companies are trying to pressure Google and other players into slowing or reversing these changes.
When Apple's iOS 14 required apps using ad tracking to request user permission,
Facebook cried foul and is claiming that these &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-idfa-ios14-small-business/"&gt;privacy protections hurt small businesses&lt;/a&gt;.
The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) at the request of advertising market participants
is specifically investigating the changes to Chrome and the Privacy Sandbox.
Only the big ad players want to keep the status quo for ad tracking.
These tactics might delay things, but with users and governments asking for privacy improvements, they're going to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generally oppose all of these attempts at tracking users across the web,
and are building on a more privacy-focused foundation of contextual ad targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-do-these-changes-affect-ethical-advertising"&gt;How do these changes affect ethical advertising?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our small ethical advertising segment of the industry,
these changes will have pretty minimal effect.
Third-party cookies and all their prospective replacements
are all about gathering information on you (and millions of people like you)
in order to target ads to you based on your interests or to you personally.
Ethical advertising doesn't use third-party cookies
and doesn't store personal information.
We aren't trying to show ads to you personally, but instead
like traditional advertising on TV, in newspapers, or in magazines,
ethical ads are targeted to the content of the page.
We put ads for developers on developer focused sites. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February was our best month ever for advertising.
Despite being a shorter month, we were still able to beat our previous bests from &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/02/ethicalads-newsletter-january-2021/"&gt;January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$23,854.36&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.
  Of this, $11,671.47 was publishers other than our own publisher (Read the Docs) which is a 5.5% increase over January.
  Going forward, we're going to report these numbers together.
  In March and beyond, we expect the revenue to outside publishers will surpass revenue to our own site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;106 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;13,600,740&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're working hard to grow revenue for all our publishers, and we're expecting another record month in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the major features we added in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the business side, we released our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;Q2 prospectus&lt;/a&gt;
  which contains some of our new testimonials and some small additions like mentioning that CPC-based pricing is available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our ad client, we rolled out our dark mode improvements
  built on &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme"&gt;&lt;code&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  to our beta client which is used by Read the Docs. This means sites that want to try it out can do so.
  Some Sphinx documentation themes already are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our ad server, we improved a few reports (notably a report required by &lt;a href="https://acceptableads.com/"&gt;Acceptable Ads&lt;/a&gt;)
  and made some tweaks to speed up our throughput.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our infrastructure, we're really pushing the I/O on our server which is writing tens of times per second.
  We worked to try to alleviate some of this pressure and that will continue into March.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While not strictly ads related, Read the Docs did extend an offer to a new person to join our team!
  More on that later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still aim to hire a part-time &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/jobs/account-manager-part-time/"&gt;account manager&lt;/a&gt;
to help manage advertiser and publisher relationships.
Hiring is always hard and takes a lot of time to do well.
If this role sounds interesting to you,
please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@ethicalads.io?subject=Ads%20account%20manager%20role"&gt;get in touch with any questions&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/jobs/account-manager-part-time/"&gt;apply&lt;/a&gt;!
In addition, Read the Docs is hiring a &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/job-frontend/"&gt;frontend developer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure will continue to cause some headaches in the next few months.
Read the Docs Community completed a move from Azure to AWS in February
and EthicalAds will probably follow suit in the next few months.
In addition, we've been hitting I/O limits as I mentioned above and while we've made improvements there
and our latency is pretty darn good, we still want to do more.
Our data points pretty directly to faster ads performing better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to give both advertisers and publishers high level data right in their dashboard when they first login.
  These are stats like exactly how much advertising money they've spent or earned this month
  and how this month compares with last month.
  This feature is still on our roadmap but we didn't wrap it up in February.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're going to expand our advertising logic to take into account price when selecting ads.
  One advertiser has agreed to be a flex advertiser with part of their ad buys in Q2
  which will give them lower prices but not guaranteed inventory.
  This helps us ensure that as many ad slots have paid ads for our publishers while letting us balance our inventory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One publisher agreed to try out EthicalAds for some custom ad placements with non-standard sizes
  and per-month pricing rather than CPM.
  We have begun pitching this to advertisers and we may build some additional features to better support this based on interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.
Please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@ethicalads.io"&gt;email us&lt;/a&gt; if you have any ideas or feedback on our product or roadmap,
we always love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="newsletter"></category><category term="community"></category></entry><entry><title>Can you Eliminate Annoying Cookie Banners from your Site?</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/02/can-you-eliminate-annoying-cookie-banners-from-your-site/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-02-22T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-02-22T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>David Fischer</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2021-02-22:/blog/2021/02/can-you-eliminate-annoying-cookie-banners-from-your-site/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Even before the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in 2018

with its cookie consent policy, internet users have had unavoidable pop-up messages
thrust onto their screens on every page urging them to "accept all" cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside for a moment how that has conditioned people to discard their privacy with a single click,
the experience is challenging on laptops. On mobile, it can be especially painful
with the cookie banner often occupying the majority of the smartphone's screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width: 300px; margin: 2rem auto;"&gt;
  &lt;img class="w-100" src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2021-cookie-banners-ft-example.png" alt="A cookie banner on the Financial Times taking up about half the screen"&gt;
  &lt;p class="text-center"&gt;&lt;small&gt;A cookie banner on the Financial Times taking up about half the screen&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-exactly-are-these-cookie-banners-needed"&gt;Why exactly are these cookie banners needed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://gdpr.eu/cookies/"&gt;EU's GDPR&lt;/a&gt; requires that web sites get consent from visitors &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; setting any non-essential cookies.
"Non-Essential Cookies" are those that are not strictly required for your site to function.
For example, a cookie to keep you logged in may be essential but an analytics cookie from a third-party would not be.
&lt;a href="https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa"&gt;California's Consumer Privacy Act&lt;/a&gt; (CCPA) requires only that visitors be notified of the use of cookies
if they are used for the purpose of collecting personal information; consent is not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-can-a-site-eliminate-cookie-banners"&gt;How can a site eliminate cookie banners?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple in theory, but can be difficult depending on how your site works.
If you don't collect personal information or allow third parties to collect personal information
and you only set essential cookies,
you will not need to set a cookie banner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most sites, the cookies that trigger the laws and violate user privacy are advertising cookies
and website analytics.
Until recently these have been difficult to do without.
Advertising is a proven business model for high traffic websites
and analytics are critical to understanding your site and users.
However, the internet has responded to users demand for increased privacy by providing privacy-aware services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="privacy-oriented-services-that-eliminate-the-requirement-of-cookie-banners"&gt;Privacy-oriented services that eliminate the requirement of cookie banners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to analytics, the internet has seen a host of alternatives to industry giant Google Analytics come to market.
They include &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/"&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://usefathom.com"&gt;Fathom&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://plausible.io/"&gt;Plausible&lt;/a&gt; and more.
These either don't set cookies at all or can easily be configured not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a solution for internet advertising that doesn't trigger cookie banners or violate user privacy has been a larger challenge.
Some ad tech companies are working hard to keep tracking and targeting users without cookies.
This may meet the letter of the law, but definitely violates its intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the many reasons we built EthicalAds.
Our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/"&gt;vision for advertising&lt;/a&gt; is that ads can work well without tracking users.
Instead of setting advertising cookies and learning from users' browsing history,
we focus by advertising only to developers and target ads based on content alone.
And &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2018/04/ethical-advertising-works/"&gt;this approach works&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're tired of seeing a cookie banner on your site,
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publishers/"&gt;join EthicalAds&lt;/a&gt; and ditch those annoying banners!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Greg Muscarella for the inspiration and feedback on this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="cookies"></category></entry><entry><title>EthicalAds Newsletter - January 2021</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2021/02/ethicalads-newsletter-january-2021/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-02-08T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-02-08T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>David Fischer</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2021-02-08:/blog/2021/02/ethicalads-newsletter-january-2021/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="january-advertising-stats"&gt;January advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;

While the year always …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2 id="january-advertising-stats"&gt;January advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, we returned to growth as expected from a slow holiday season.
While the year always starts a little slow, January started with a lot of advertiser interest and publishers
interested in making money with ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$10,566.78&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers, a 12% increase from December and 5% increase from November, our previous peak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;103 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;6,095,608&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Docs, our own publisher, generated &lt;strong&gt;$16,381.53&lt;/strong&gt; on 6,929,551 paid ad impressions. Of our reported metrics, this was the only one down slightly and it was due to a few large advertisers balancing their spend between Read the Docs and our larger ad network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For February, we are expecting another record breaking month in terms of daily traffic, daily revenue, and ads served.
It may not be as high as January in total (it'll be very close) but that's simply due to the number of days in the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the major features we added in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our ad client, we built a feature that allows ads to be displayed in light-mode or dark-mode
  based on the user's preferences if the publisher displaying the ad also supports this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our ad server, we added a number of quality of life improvements,
  including automating some advertiser setup and fixing some minor data consistency bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our infrastructure, we started archiving old, raw data on ad impressions
  (remember, we &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/"&gt;do not track user personal data&lt;/a&gt;)
  to keep our transactional database small and fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On our website, we put up a job opening which we'll talk about in the next section.
  We also launched some more advertiser and publisher testimonials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="growing-our-team"&gt;Growing our team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We posted a new part-time &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/jobs/account-manager-part-time/"&gt;job opening&lt;/a&gt;
and we're hoping to bring somebody on to help manage advertiser and publisher relationships.
The job is going to be heavy on customer service but has some
light sales and marketing involved too.
This person will have a lot of impact on how EthicalAds continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person will work directly with me (David) and with Eric
to make sure our publishers are getting as much money as they can
while our advertisers are getting the best results we can deliver.
We pride ourselves on the high level of service we provide,
and working closely with both publishers and advertisers helps to get great results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this role sounds interesting to you,
please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@ethicalads.io?subject=Ads%20account%20manager%20role"&gt;get in touch with any questions&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/jobs/account-manager-part-time/"&gt;apply&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Read the Docs is hiring a &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/job-frontend/"&gt;frontend developer&lt;/a&gt;
and a &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/job-devrel/"&gt;developer advocate with documentation skills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned in December, hiring and onboarding new team members are hard work and require a lot of time to do well.
Now that we've started getting applications, we expect that this will take some time
but the end result will hopefully be faster responses to our advertisers and publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring new people really can't come soon enough.
Between the the time spent on hiring (which is very important to get right),
time spent on working on &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/czi-grant-announcement/"&gt;Read the Docs' CZI grant&lt;/a&gt;,
and some upcoming infrastructure changes at Read the Docs,
we're all feeling spread a bit thin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to give both advertisers and publishers high level data right in their dashboard when they first login.
  These are stats like exactly how much advertising money they've spent or earned this month
  and how this month compares with last month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're hoping to expand our advertising logic to take into account price when selecting ads.
  One advantage of this would allow us to have lower priority advertisers who buy ads at a lower rate
  but don't receive guarantees of inventory. This is helpful to make sure publishers are always showing paid ads
  while letting us balance our inventory.
  In January, we did start pitching this advertisers but haven't sold it or completed building it yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We started exploring customized ad placements on single high-value publishers.
  This is different from our traditional ad offering which shows ads across our network
  and instead focuses on buying most or all inventory for a single publisher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.

Considering the major holidays …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2 id="december-advertising-stats"&gt;December advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December was a slightly down month here at EthicalAds from our record-breaking November.
Considering the major holidays, I'll still call that a win.
The bulk of our advertising is shown during business hours and there were a lot fewer business hours in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$9,373.04&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers, a 7% decrease from November.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;89 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;5,227,541&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2020/12/ethicalads-newsletter-november-2020/"&gt;November&lt;/a&gt;, we mentioned we were holding out hope of a December increase
while mentioning that it is a historically down month for advertising.
We got pretty close, but weren't quite able to get there.
For January, in spite of the New Years holiday which results in a few days of lower traffic,
we're expecting a return to growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's amazing to look back and realize that while we've been sustaining Read the Docs with advertising for a few years now,
our wider EthicalAds network just started in July and we've been going for only six months.
In just those six months, we've grown from nothing and generated &lt;strong&gt;$42,239&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="read-the-docs-advertising-stats"&gt;Read the Docs advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2021, we wanted to begin to also report Read the Docs' advertising stats just like we're doing for the ad network.
We've reported these numbers previously in yearly &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2019-stats/"&gt;Read the Docs stats posts&lt;/a&gt;
but not on a monthly basis like we are for EthicalAds.
We will continue to break out third-party publishers just as we have been so stats will continue to be comparable month over month.
For Read the Docs in December, we achieved &lt;strong&gt;$17,656.37&lt;/strong&gt; in advertising revenue on &lt;strong&gt;8,575,795&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views.
Our goal here is to treat our own publisher, Read the Docs, as just a regular publisher as far as the ad network is concerned.
From a company perspective, we will be separating them out in terms of accounting and budget as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big things we added last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We broke out our headlines and calls to action in our ads.
  This allows publishers with custom integrations to style them differently and gives advertisers
  a convenient way to show which content should be called out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added some new reporting for advertisers to break down their performance by geography and by publisher.
  We expect that as advertisers analyze this data we are going to get requests to advertise only on specific publishers
  or on more limited geographic subsets. We are still working out exactly how to sell that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We rolled out some testimonials from advertisers and publishers on this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also delivered a &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;new prospectus for Q1 2021&lt;/a&gt;.
  The largest change was a modest price increase for targeting the US &amp;amp; Canada
  where demand continues to outstrip our supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="growing-our-team"&gt;Growing our team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month we mentioned that we'd be hoping to expand our team and that's going to start this month.
Both the Read the Docs team and the ads team are going to expand
and job postings will be up by the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For advertising, we are looking to bring on a part-time person
to help manage advertiser and publisher relationships.
At the beginning, this role will involve some customer service along with some light sales and marketing,
but the role could specialize in either direction as we continue to grow.
As I mentioned, this will start as a part-time role but we hope it will become a full-time role
by the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person will work directly with me (David) and with Eric
to make sure our publishers are getting as much money as they can
while our advertisers are getting the best results we can deliver.
Unlike many SaaS businesses, advertising is a little higher touch,
and working closely with both publishers and advertisers helps to get great results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this role sounds interesting to you, please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@ethicalads.io?subject=Ads%20relationship%20manager%20role"&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both hiring and afterward onboarding new team members are hard work and require a lot of time to do well.
We expect that this will take some time but the end result will hopefully be faster responses
to our advertisers and publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 2021, we want to treat Read the Docs as simply another publisher
and this means separating out the budget and accounting of each.
To get specific, we'll be attributing 70% of ad revenue on Read the Docs to Read the Docs itself
and count the other 30% of the revenue toward the EthicalAds network just as we do with third-party publishers.
This will let us better allocate resources to grow both sides of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another upcoming challenge in the next month is an engineering challenge around how we save data for long term archival.
While we &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/"&gt;explicitly do not track user personal data&lt;/a&gt;,
we still end up storing a large amount of data on ad impressions
in case we get issues with fraud or merely a billing dispute.
This data is close to exceeding what's reasonable to store in our transactional database and we'll need to move
into a system that can scale up a lot but it won't have real-time requirements.
While this is a fairly well-understood OLTP/OLAP kind of problem,
adding new infrastructure to our reporting is never easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to give both advertisers and publishers high level data right in their dashboard when they first login.
  These are stats like exactly how much advertising money they've spent or earned this month
  and how this month compares with last month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're hoping to expand our advertising logic to take into account price when selecting ads.
  This will allow us to assure maximum revenue for a publisher,
  but we don't want to always show a single ad on that site, either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We hope to do a beta test of a sponsorship program with a publisher,
  which is an extension of the ad network to allow for specific and customized placements on high-value publishers.
  If you're get advertisers asking you directly how to advertise on your site,
  please let us know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for being along with us on this journey to build an ethical ad network.

&lt;p&gt;November was a record-breaking month here at EthicalAds.
Even though we had a major US holiday and only 30 days,
we were able to increase publisher revenue by over 30% this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major driver of increased revenue was being added to the Acceptable Ads list in mid-November.
We estimate this will increase publisher revenue by 10-15%,
which explains a lot of the increase in publisher revenue.
The other major driver of revenue is adding additional publishers to the network,
which we continue to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$10,059.39&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers, breaking $10,000 for the first time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;79 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;5,484,006&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited that all of our core metrics increased this month.
We hope they will continue to increase in December,
but December is historically a low traffic month because there are more global holidays,
so we'll have to wait to find out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big things we added this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were approved for the Acceptable Ads program, which required changes to both our server and client to track traffic we can attribute to the program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added reporting for Advertisers to see what Countries and Publishers their ads are showing on the most.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added keyword reporting for Publishers. This allows them to see the performance of the various keywords they are sending on incoming traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We improved our payout workflow, which is part of the work required to lower our payout limit of $50.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added backend support for Fill Rate tracking. This allows us to understand more about how ads are being filled across keywords, geos, and publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month has felt like the ad network has really hit its stride.
The inclusion of EthicalAds on the Acceptable Ads program is a major benefit,
and has removed our longest-running difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of launching the ad network,
we have had 2 members of the team (Eric &amp;amp; David) fully focused on advertising.
As we look to grow the network,
we are hoping to expand our team by at least one person in the near future.
We have started thinking about a job description for the person we hope to bring on.
Hiring is always a challenge,
but we're excited about having growth to be able to think about supporting an additional team member.
The role we're imagining is an part-time account executive,
but someone who is interested in growing into a larger full-time business role over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this transition,
our team member Eric will be scaling back his involvement on advertising from close to 100% of time to 50%.
This will allow us to bring on an additional team member without hurting our budget too much,
until we can fully support having a team of 3 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also almost fully completed the separation of Read the Docs and EthicalAds.
In January 2021,
we are planning to fully separate the businesses in terms of our accounting and budget.
This will be the end result of the transition of Read the Docs to being a normal Publisher on EthicalAds.
It will likely take us a few months to fully work through this transition,
but it will allow us to grow advertising more quickly as we see growth in the ad network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features in our upcoming roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're still hoping to adapt our ad format to &lt;a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server/issues/152"&gt;break out a headline and a call to action&lt;/a&gt;. This will standardize our ad display, along with making sure that all our advertisers have ads that work across multiple formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to give advertisers a way to change the flight targeting of their advertisements. Changing targeting generally changes the pricing, so this will require the dashboard knowing more about pricing for different targeting options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're hoping to expand our advertising logic to take into account price when selecting ads. This will allow us to assure maximum revenue for a publisher, but we don't want to always show a single ad on that site, either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We hope to do a beta test of a sponsorship program with a publisher, which is an extension of the ad network to allow for specific placements on high-value publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October was another productive month on our side.
We continue to onboard new publishers and advertisers.
Growing the network each month feels great,
and we're always looking for more folks to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of development,
we've been focusing a lot on performance and reporting improvements.
This work makes sure ads load fast, which improves the user experience.
The additional reporting improvements we've made should help publishers understand the ads running on their site in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of stats, in October 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$7,580.43&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;72 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;4,571,606&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, we actually had fewer ad views this month, mostly because one of larger publishers had some integration issues.
We were able to increase revenue though with fewer ads,
which shows that our pricing increases are starting to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big things we added this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have started adding &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publishers/readthedocs/"&gt;testimonials&lt;/a&gt; to our website from our publishers and advertisers. We only have a couple completed, but will be adding more in the near future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have added reporting for publishers that show Geo and Advertiser breakdowns. These are in beta and will be enabled for everyone this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have added &lt;a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-client/pull/29/"&gt;viewport tracking&lt;/a&gt; to our ad client. This is a backstop to our Publisher Policy, confirming that ads are actually viewed for billing purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We migrated our hosting infrastructure from a Docker-based solution to a VM-based solution. This brought a 3x improvement to our average server response latency, which is now 45ms on average and 75ms at the 99th percentile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As part of this server migration we have built the capability to do &lt;a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server/pull/260/files"&gt;periodic report generation&lt;/a&gt;. We're currently updating the Geo reports each hour, but will tweak this over time as we figure out what the best options here are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also updated our ad integration on Read the Docs to use the standard ethical-ad-client. This is one of the last steps of making Read the Docs "just another publisher" and not be special. As part of this, we removed legacy ad types, and now all ads are the same image+text or image-only ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like we've managed to address most of our existing issues. Our server performance has been a nagging issue since launched, and it's very excited to have fixed it and seen quite impressive gains. Having additional infrastructure to handle periodic reporting is also another major thing we needed to do, so that we can add more reporting without impacting advertising performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a signed contract with the Acceptable Ads program, which is a major milestone. We expect this change to roll out early in November, which we forecast will bring an increase of 15% more ads shown. This will increase our publishers revenue and removes a large structural barrier that we faced to competing with other advertising networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our ongoing worries is about balancing supply and demand on the network. Especially with keyword targeting, it can be hard to maintain fill rates across our publisher network while also fully filling campaigns for our advertisers. We expect this will continue to be a difficult task forever, but we're slowly starting to understand how to balance this tension. We're also working to manage expectations on both sides, knowing that forecasting web traffic isn't an exact science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our upcoming roadmap has a few major tasks on it this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're planning to adapt our ad format to &lt;a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server/issues/152"&gt;break out a headline and a call to action&lt;/a&gt;. This will standardize our ad display, along with making sure that all our advertisers have ads that work across multiple formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're working on a Publisher Prospectus, which is similar to our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;advertiser prospectus&lt;/a&gt; -- a single place to understand what being a publisher looks like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We didn't get to it last month, but we want additional publisher &amp;amp; advertiser landing pages. We hope to build topic-specific pages to share more information for specific audiences on these pages, to go along with our testimonials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We started conversations about trademarking EthicalAds, but haven't applied for it yet. This process will take 4-6 months, but we do want to make sure we've gotten it started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We plan to take our expanded publisher reports and add similar improvements to our advertising reports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many other small tasks we'll continue to work on, along with lots of email :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for following along on our journey, and we're excited to continue to build something we can all be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="newsletter"></category><category term="community"></category></entry><entry><title>EthicalAds Newsletter - September 2020</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2020/10/ethicalads-newsletter-september-2020/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-06T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-10-06T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Eric Holscher</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2020-10-06:/blog/2020/10/ethicalads-newsletter-september-2020/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2 id="advertising-stats"&gt;Advertising stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September was a solid month of growth for our EthicalAds Network.
We have continued to onboard additional publishers and expand our list of advertisers.
We have also released our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;Q4 advertiser prospectus&lt;/a&gt; which has raised some of our prices given the increased interest we're seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in prices should start showing up throughout the month of September for our publishers.
Publisher revenue is the thing we care most about,
and we're happy to report that it grew &lt;strong&gt;32%&lt;/strong&gt; this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$6,966.84&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers -- so close to $7k!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;65 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;4,829,240&lt;/strong&gt; paid ad views across the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued to add more features for publishers and advertisers to understand what is happening on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big things we added this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/"&gt;new website&lt;/a&gt; with an updated design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We combined our Read the Docs &amp;amp; EthicalAds landing pages and prospectus, so we only have a single source of that information now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/prospectus/ethicalads-advertiser-prospectus.pdf"&gt;Q4 advertiser prospectus&lt;/a&gt; with updated topics and pricing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad client support for &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#ad-placement-reporting"&gt;placement reporting&lt;/a&gt; which allows seeing reports for specific placements on your site (eg. an ad on a list screen vs. a detail screen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad client support for &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#page-specific-keywords"&gt;per-page keywords&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see our latest updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;ethical-ad-server changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current top priority continues to be getting publishers more revenue. As part of that mission we have raised prices on some of our more popular targeting options for Q4, and are expanding the topics we are targeting to better reflect out publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to have issues with ad blocking. We have had a good call with the Acceptable Ads team, and are hopeful that we will be added to the approved list in October. That will raise most of our publishers revenues by an estimated 15%, which would be huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other major thing we continue to struggle with is just the amount of work we need to do. Spinning up an entirely new ad network and brand requires a lot of various tasks, and we only have 2 people working on it mostly full-time. We are in discussion in Q4 about doing some kind of hiring, either contract or part-time with the revenue we're seeing from the ad network. We generally try to be conservative in our hiring, so it might get pushed back to next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We managed to achieve 3 of the 5 &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2020/09/ethicalads-newsletter-august-2020/#upcoming-features"&gt;features we wanted from last month&lt;/a&gt;.
We are still planning to write more blog content and ship a publisher prospectus, but they were pushed back by more pressing work this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, our roadmap this month includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A number of reporting improvements for both advertisers and publishers, to better understand their traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adapt Read the Docs to use our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;official ad client&lt;/a&gt; instead of the custom integration we have now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trademark "EthicalAds", now that we are using it as a brand. We hope we will be able to get it, otherwise we might need to consider a re-brand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional publisher &amp;amp; advertiser landing pages. We hope to build topic-specific pages to share more information for specific audiences on these pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get testimonials from our users. We have now been serving network ads for close to 3 months, so we should have some happy customers now :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the big roadmap items for us this next month, but we always have additional tasks each month like replying to email and processing payouts.
We'll continue working diligently to bring the best ad network that we can to the developer community,
and we're glad you're with us for the journey.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="newsletter"></category><category term="community"></category></entry><entry><title>EthicalAds Newsletter - August 2020</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2020/09/ethicalads-newsletter-august-2020/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-03T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-09-03T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Eric Holscher</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2020-09-03:/blog/2020/09/ethicalads-newsletter-august-2020/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're excited to share you with our first newsletter,

where we'll share updates about our progress.
Inspired by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/coderberry"&gt;Eric Berry&lt;/a&gt; and the CodeFund team,
we'll also share our struggles and challenges.
We believe strongly that being transparent and ethical go hand in hand,
and will strive to share as much as we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="advertising-stats"&gt;Advertising Stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August is the first full month that we've served ads on our EthicalAds network.
We're excited to already be supporting so many publishers.
Making sure developers are paid for their work is a huge part of our mission,
and revenue paid out is our most important stat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We generated &lt;strong&gt;$5,375.22&lt;/strong&gt; for our publishers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had &lt;strong&gt;50 publishers&lt;/strong&gt; on our network with a paid ad impression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-features"&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're working hard on building new features as we get more feedback from our advertisers and publishers.
It's still early days,
and we really appreciate how understanding everyone has been with any confusion in our processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big things we added this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added an explicit &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publisher-policy/"&gt;Publisher Policy&lt;/a&gt; to set expectations in our relationship with our publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added an &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/faq/"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; to the EthicalAds site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We documented our &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/"&gt;Ad Vision&lt;/a&gt; on the website, showing how we're different than other ad networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We improved our fraud detection mechanisms to be smarter about rate limiting ad views and detect when users are using a proxy to view the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publishers can now store payout setting in the dashboard directly. This improves our workflow for paying out publishers, hopefully making it smoother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always see the latest code updates in our &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/changelog.html"&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tricky-bits"&gt;Tricky bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current priority is getting publishers more money. We know that we're a little bit below what some other networks are able to pay because of how new we are. We're fully focused on improving this situation, and it has happened for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our largest issue in August was getting added to the main ad block lists. We're currently working with the team at Eyeo (AdBlock Plus) to get our new ads on the Acceptable Ads list. Ad blocking removed 30% of our total traffic, which was a large impact. Being put on Acceptable Ads &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2018/05/update-on-ad-blocking-and-acceptable-ads/"&gt;got around 50% of those blocked views back&lt;/a&gt; when it happened to Read the Docs in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two other places we're working to improve this situation: raising our prices and selling more of our inventory. Since we had to scramble to get everything sold when we launched in July, we didn't have time to adjust our prices and do a full sales cycle with our advertisers. The other aspect is that a lot of our APAC inventory is unsold. For some of our publishers, this means 50% of ad views aren't currently being monetized. We generally recommend &lt;a href="https://ethical-ad-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#customization"&gt;falling back to other content&lt;/a&gt; in these cases, if that is something you're comfortable doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-features"&gt;Upcoming features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a number of new things on our roadmap for September.
We'll try to share our upcoming roadmap,
so folks have an idea of what we're working on this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our large roadmap items are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve our codebase to support multiple placements for one Publisher. This will be useful for sites with multiple placements that want to track performance between them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unify the old advertising pages on Read the Docs with our new EthicalAds ones, making everything a bit clearer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve Publisher onboarding, including sharing more information about expectations in a Publisher prospectus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ship our Q4 prospectus, with some additional improvements around explaining what EthicalAds is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write more blog content around how to market to developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

a privacy-focused ad network for developers.
We think advertising is one of the best ways to fund open source development,
and we have first hand experience.
Ethical advertising was first created to make Read the Docs,
our own open source project,
sustainable.
We're now bringing ethical ads to other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've found that privacy preserving ads are a win for both developers and advertisers.
Advertisers are able to target developers on the sites they frequent without being blocked.
Developers trust our ads because our code is open source, and we're developers ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-background"&gt;The background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethical advertising as a concept was something we &lt;a href="https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2016/aug/31/funding-oss-marketing-money/#funding-read-the-docs"&gt;originally conceived&lt;/a&gt; for Read the Docs back in 2016.
We were an open source project trying to find sustainability,
and advertising was the answer we knew we needed.
We knew our users cared about privacy,
so we decided to build the most privacy-focused ad solution we could.
We have been working on building a sturdy business around advertising ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we started building this vision,
we were inspired to see CodeFund adopt our ideals and push them forward.
We were sad when we heard CodeFund was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/codefundio/status/1278119643937296384"&gt;shutting down&lt;/a&gt; on July 1 of this year.
We talked with Eric Berry at CodeFund,
deciding to launch our network in beta to provide a smooth transition for the people depending on that money each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've spent the last month onboarding over 50 publishers.
&lt;strong&gt;Developers have already earned more than $5,000 since we launched&lt;/strong&gt;.
We're excited to officially announce that we're open for additional publishers and advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="our-vision"&gt;Our vision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethical ads respect users while still providing value to advertisers.
The vision is pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don’t track you or sell your data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We only make money showing ads, so our interests are fully aligned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We target ads based on the content of the current page, not your past browsing history&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are as transparent in our business as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We only show high quality ads from companies that are of interest to developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we talked about in our &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/ethical-advertising-works/"&gt;2018 blog post&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;ethical advertising works&lt;/strong&gt;.
We're thrilled to be able to bring our vision of advertising to a larger audience,
and help fund open source without compromise.
Our &lt;a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server"&gt;entire ad server&lt;/a&gt; is open source,
so you can inspect how we're doing things.
We believe strongly in open source,
and we practice what we preach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="join-us"&gt;Join us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are planning to grow slowly in the near term,
making sure that everything we've built is ready for new demands.
We've already learned a number of lessons in the last month,
and we want to make sure our ads work well for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethical advertising is our vision for the future of internet advertising,
and we hope that you'll join us.
We have space for additional publishers and advertisers,
and look forward to building something meaningful with you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a while since our
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2019/06/ad-funding-at-read-the-docs-and-whats-next-for-ethical-advertising/"&gt;last advertising update …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a while since our
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2019/06/ad-funding-at-read-the-docs-and-whats-next-for-ethical-advertising/"&gt;last advertising update&lt;/a&gt;
and it felt like a good time to talk about what's working
with our advertising model and how things are getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-advertising-is-working-for-read-the-docs"&gt;How advertising is working for Read the Docs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2019-stats/"&gt;2019 stats post&lt;/a&gt;,
we broke out our advertising revenue which was fairly flat
year over year. The way our ad business is structured, our revenue
mostly grows with increases in traffic and Read the Docs is mature
enough that it isn't doubling in size every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, we're pleased with our steady and sustainable growth.
Read the Docs doesn't have any investors putting pressure on us for
short term growth and that has allowed us to invest in our ad business,
commercial hosting, and in our community version for the long term.
We've rolled out a huge number of improvements to all the sides of our
business in the last year and we're happy with the results. Advertising
remains the single largest source of funding for Read the Docs and one
that scales as our costs scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a real world note, Covid-19 had a short term impact on our
advertising revenue with a number of advertisers understandably pulling
back due to uncertainty in funding and the economy in general. While the
world isn't completely back to normal, we have returned some degree of
normalcy and most of these advertisers returned once there was a bit
more clarity in the broader economy and the virus' effect on the tech
industry specifically. Advertising on Read the Docs is now close to
capacity in the US, Canada, and Europe which are our largest advertising
markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="improved-targeting-for-ads"&gt;Improved targeting for ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising on Read the Docs is different from most ad networks out
there. Our ad targeting is based on the content and the reader's
geography rather than personal data about our users. Read the Docs'
authors and readers have told us that privacy is important to them.
That's great because it's important to us too! With that said, there
are great ways to target specific content niches with ads relevant to
those readers without compromising on privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, we chose a few groups of content advertisers can target where
we have enough traffic without the ads being focused on a tiny number of
projects. These niches are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data science and machine learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend web development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backend web development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DevOps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested this improved content targeting with a select group of
advertisers and the results were great. In some cases we saw click
through rates more than double. Whether the ad is to hire a developer or
to promote a service, we always want to deliver ads that are most
relevant to the documentation being served. This results in better value
to our advertisers while still respecting the privacy of our readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would your company like to get in front of more developers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell your &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/"&gt;marketing or recruiting team&lt;/a&gt; about Read the Docs and show
them how they can reach over 7 million developers who Read the Docs each
month!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="open-sourcing-our-ad-server"&gt;Open sourcing our ad server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we've wanted to do for a long time is open source the code we
use to run advertising at Read the Docs. While there's always a bit of
an incentive to keep advertising code closed so it can't be abused, our
hope is that the trust we're building with the ethical ads model can be
used by others who want to run their own ethical advertising. Read the
Docs is an open source company and it's nice to have all our code out
there. We call it the ethical ad server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ethical ad server is built to handle the kind of load Read the Docs
itself receives -- over a million hits per day -- and it delivers
advertising based only on content and geographic targeting rather than
building up user profiles from personal information. It's built from
the ground up with user privacy in mind. We're excited to share it with
you so please &lt;a href="https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server"&gt;check out the code on
GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as we're constantly delivering improvements to Read the Docs
itself for our readers and project maintainers, we also strive to give a
better experience and better results to the companies who trust Read the
Docs as a marketing channel. I want to thank all our advertisers who
believe in our approach and continue to support us and stay tuned to
this space for more great features in the future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ethical ad network is just about ready for launch and we're
actively looking for projects to beta test the network. If you run a
developer focused website and you're looking for a way to earn money

&lt;p&gt;This post first appeared
on the &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/ad-funding-read-the-docs-whats-next/"&gt;Read the Docs company blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been three years since we first launched
&lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/ads-on-read-the-docs/"&gt;ads on Read the Docs&lt;/a&gt;
and while we gave a limited update in our
&lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/read-the-docs-2018-stats/"&gt;2018 stats&lt;/a&gt;,
we figured it was time to give an update on ethical advertising and how
it is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="advertising-without-tracking"&gt;Advertising without tracking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our ethical advertising model is still going strong.&lt;/strong&gt; We proved that
it is possible to build a business model on top of advertising without
resorting to user tracking. Unlike most other ad-supported sites, we
show advertising based on the context of the page, not by creating
behavoral profiles of large numbers of individual users. If you are
browsing documentation for a Python project, you might see a relevant ad
about Python. It's that simple and it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a slow start to the year, we expect to earn about $75,000 from
advertising in Q2. This brings our advertising revenue back to the level
before our ads were
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2018/05/ads-and-ad-blockers/"&gt;added to major ad blocking lists&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we do earn money from other sources such as our &lt;a href="https://readthedocs.com"&gt;commercial
offering&lt;/a&gt;, advertising continues to be our
largest source of revenue and has allowed us to expand our team to five
full-time people. Compared with three years ago when we were scraping
along with very little money, our community issue tracker and support
requests receive prompt responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="progress"&gt;Progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've made great progress on advertising over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We survived a major hit to revenue from ad blocking without
    resorting to cat and mouse games of changing ad layouts and APIs to
    avoid ad blockers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/page/advertising/ethical-advertising.html#community-ads"&gt;community ads
    program&lt;/a&gt;
    has been significantly expanded. We are actively running free
    community advertising promoting over ten open source projects and
    conferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we never tracked users with advertising, we put in place
    stricter &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/do-not-track/"&gt;Do Not Track&lt;/a&gt;
    privacy protections. We continue to believe that
    advertising can be well targeted without tracking users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We launched an advertising vertical to let companies
    &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2019/01/lessons-from-and-for-hiring-managers/"&gt;promote their open jobs&lt;/a&gt; to developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our advertising revenue share program tripled in size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ethical advertising approach, with no user tracking, has been key to
our sustainability and has allowed Read the Docs to continue to build
new features and give back to our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-next"&gt;What's next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have some really interesting developments coming regarding ethical
advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking to add a few more projects to our ad &lt;strong&gt;revenue share
program&lt;/strong&gt; and help more projects reach sustainability with an ethical
advertising approach. If your project on Read the Docs does 100k+
pageviews per month and you are interested in exploring a new revenue
stream, please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@readthedocs.org?subject=Ethical%20Ads%20revenue%20share"&gt;let us
know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are testing a &lt;strong&gt;new text-only ad format&lt;/strong&gt; which we will detail in a
future post. Text-only ads are something we've wanted for a while
because we believe they are less intrusive to readers but easy for
advertisers to experiment with multiple variations. So far the results
have been very promising and we are planning to roll this out more
widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;strong&gt;ethical ad network&lt;/strong&gt; is getting closer to launch. It's a shame,
but there's a critical lack of funding for open source projects that
form the building blocks of some extremely valuable software. We believe
that advertising can fill some of that gap and Read the Docs can help by
sharing some of the lessons we've learned building our own advertising.
If you know a site that might be interested in being a beta tester of a
pro-privacy ad network built specifically to help fund open source,
please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@readthedocs.org?subject=Ethical%20Ad%20Network%20beta"&gt;get in
touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thanks"&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisers always have a choice where to direct their marketing spend
and for many of them it would have been simpler to just go with the
usual behemoth advertising platforms rather than advertising with a
niche site like Read the Docs. I want to thank all our advertisers who
believe in our approach and continue to support us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="readthedocs"></category></entry><entry><title>Tips for Getting a Developer Interview</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2019/02/tips-for-getting-a-developer-interview/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-13T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-02-13T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>David Fischer</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2019-02-13:/blog/2019/02/tips-for-getting-a-developer-interview/</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post first appeared
on the &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/tips-for-getting-a-developer-interview/"&gt;Read the Docs company blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last month, the Read the Docs team conducted 30-40 customer
development interviews with hiring managers and recruiters at companies
ranging from 5-person companies to the biggest names in tech. We wanted
to learn more about hiring processes at various companies with the
ultimate goal of building &lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/hiring/"&gt;a product to help companies find
developers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time, we covered some
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2019/01/lessons-from-and-for-hiring-managers/"&gt;tips for hiring managers&lt;/a&gt;
based on what companies told us they were doing. This time,
we put together &lt;strong&gt;tips for candidates looking for their next job&lt;/strong&gt; based
on insights we heard from hiring managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than covering how to crack developer interviews or how to gain
the necessary technical skills, these tips will focus on getting your
foot in the door. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making your application stand out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving your application response rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting to the interview process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="when-applying-go-deep-not-wide"&gt;When applying, go deep not wide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I don't want candidates who drive by job sites and pepper every job
they find"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a candidate, there is a temptation to play the numbers game and apply
to as many jobs as possible. Many jobs sites make it easy to apply to
many jobs quickly and this gives you that feeling that your job search
is progressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on what hiring managers told us, playing the numbers game isn't
the best approach.&lt;/strong&gt; While it is a bit of a job-seekers market,
especially for more senior talent, companies are looking people who want
to work for their company and who believe in their mission. Hiring
managers told us they want applicants who "think about the company,
then check for opportunities".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2019-facebook-job-opening.png" class="mw-100" alt="Facebook job posting with almost 300 applications in 2 weeks on just one of the job sites where this is posted."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="spend-a-little-more-time-on-your-application"&gt;Spend a little more time on your application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it takes longer to apply to a job post that requires a cover
letter or requires answers to a few questions, those are great ways to
have your application stand out relative to other applicants. You don't
want your resume to get lost in a stack of hundreds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2019/01/lessons-from-and-for-hiring-managers/"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;,
quite a few hiring managers we talked to started requiring
a cover letter or even just a couple questions that are unique to the
company in order to make their job filtering candidates easier and get
candidates who want to work there not those who just want a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the companies we talked to said when they post a job they got tons
of applicants, but that high quality, qualified applicants were still in
short supply. When 200 people apply to a job but only 20 are willing to
do a cover letter, a hiring manager can spend a lot more time per
candidate with the smaller pool. One hiring manager told us explicitly
"fewer resumes is better because there's less noise".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I know I said getting a developer job isn't a numbers game, this
doesn't strictly mean you can use these techniques to apply to 2-3 jobs
and you'll get hired. Sometimes by the time you apply, somebody is
already in the final stages of getting hired. The position may not
&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; be open anymore. Don't get discouraged in your job search.
&lt;strong&gt;Finding the right match can take time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2019-duckduckgo-application-questions.png" class="mw-100" alt="Here's some of the questions from the DuckDuckGo application process.This is your place to stand out! DuckDuckGo was **not** one of the companies we interviewed."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="make-yourself-a-referral-use-your-network"&gt;Make yourself a referral: use your network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring managers universally told us their top recruiting channel is
referrals from existing employees. As a candidate, use this knowledge to
your advantage and &lt;strong&gt;make yourself into a referral hire&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you see an acquaintance on social media post about job openings
    at their company?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does a friend or a friend of friend work at the company?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have a first connection (or a very good 2nd connection) on
    LinkedIn who works there?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all of these cases, you should contact that person before applying.
Even if the person you know isn't on the hiring team, your contact
might be able to put you in touch with the right person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most [senior] people go through their network"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a mid-level to senior candidate with 7+ years of experience, this is
even more important based on our interviews. At that stage of your
career, &lt;strong&gt;hiring managers we talked to expect a high quality candidate
to do due diligence&lt;/strong&gt; on the company and team to make sure it's a
mutual fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the exact route you take here, getting in touch with the
right people to learn more about the team, the tech stack, and the
company makes it clear that you're very interested. You're far more
likely to get a response, move on to the interview process, and
ultimately get hired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="establishing-contact-with-companies"&gt;Establishing contact with companies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning yourself into a referral is easier for a senior candidate. But
what if this is your first or second job or don't know anybody at the
company?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After referral candidates, &lt;strong&gt;the next best hiring channel in our
interviews was local meetups and engaging the local community&lt;/strong&gt;. Both
startups and established companies -- especially when they are actively
hiring -- use meetups to find talent. If you're able to meet the hiring
manager in person or establish some sort of connection, in my
experience, this raises your chances significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our interviews, another channel that mid-size and larger companies we
talked to used to recruit was to rely on their presence at conferences.
For many companies, recruiting was the primary motivator to sponsor a
conference and have a booth. As a candidate, talking to the engineers at
the booth and showing interest can ensure that your application doesn't
get lost among all the applicants they get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a smaller company, it's frequently possible to figure out exactly
who the hiring manager is from some combination of the website, hiring
posts, and LinkedIn. This is a great way to make a valuable connection
and make sure the role is a good fit. Contacting the hiring manager cold
requires a bit of finesse so make sure to be respectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Places like the monthly HackerNews Who's Hiring thread are fantastic
because they allow direct interaction with the hiring manager and many
companies list a person's direct email to inquire about a position,
learn more directly from the source, and show you're interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2019-hiring-manager-phrases.png" class="mw-100" alt="Here's some of the phrases we heard from hiring managers in
interviews."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By spending a bit more time on your application, establishing contact
with the company, and asking good questions about the work and team, you
are showing your intent and interest in the company.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to make sure the hiring manager or recruiter understands that
you're a serious candidate and you want to work there on their team.
Using these methods will improve your response rate and &lt;strong&gt;help you get
the interview&lt;/strong&gt;. By doing a one-click apply on a job site, this is
completely lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thanks"&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I'd like to thank all the hiring managers who took the time to
talk to us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="hiring"></category><category term="readthedocs"></category></entry><entry><title>Lessons From and For Hiring Managers</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2019/01/lessons-from-and-for-hiring-managers/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-30T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-01-30T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>David Fischer</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2019-01-30:/blog/2019/01/lessons-from-and-for-hiring-managers/</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post first appeared
on the &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/lessons-from-hiring-manager-interviews/"&gt;Read the Docs company blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last four weeks, the Read the Docs team did dozens of customer
development interviews with engineering hiring managers. We wanted to
learn more about hiring processes at various companies with the ultimate
goal of building a product to help companies find developers. We talked
to people looking for talent at five person companies all the way up to
the biggest names in tech. In this post, I am going to cover some of the
common things we heard from hiring managers and &lt;strong&gt;share some ways for
hiring managers to improve their company's process&lt;/strong&gt;. In our
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2019/02/tips-for-getting-a-developer-interview/"&gt;next post in this series&lt;/a&gt;,
I will have some actionable tips for job seekers based on
the same interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is a long post, I figured I'd share some of the key
takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a strategy for getting more referrals&lt;/strong&gt; whether that is
    actively asking employees or having an overly generous referral
    bonus. Referrals are probably your top source of candidates so
    figuring out how to get more will save you time and money in the
    end. Then do the same for your other best recruiting channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reach passive candidates&lt;/strong&gt;. There are a lot more passive
    candidates than active ones so have a plan to reach them. Great
    developers (especially senior ones) probably aren't actively
    looking for a new job and it's a job-seekers market. Even if
    somebody isn't considering a new job at all, the next time they do,
    you want them to think of your company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recruiting for diversity is a focus&lt;/strong&gt; for hiring managers. Put
    together a concrete plan for getting more diverse candidates and
    meeting your diversity goals. Engaging with local developer
    communities and nonprofits and encouraging referrals worked well for
    companies we talked to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get more signal in your application process&lt;/strong&gt; by adding a step
    such as a cover letter, quiz, or simply add a couple questions folks
    have to answer. Making candidates spend even one extra minute on
    their application can save you hours filtering resumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-is-read-the-docs-tackling-hiring-hasnt-that-been-done"&gt;Why is Read the Docs tackling hiring? Hasn't that been done?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we didn't initially think about Read the Docs ads for recruiting,
based on some
unexpected past successes](hiring-developers-with-readthedocs.md),
we decided to position promoted jobs as one of our main
verticals within our advertising. Rather than dash forward and create a
product, however, we started by just talking to hiring managers to
understand the hiring process better so we can best meet their needs
with something we create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the questions we asked in our interviews was how long it took to
hire their most recent developer? Specifically, we asked hiring managers
to consider how much time they and their team spent sourcing candidates,
filtering resumes, preparing for and doing phone and onsite interviews,
and anything else. Internal recruiters' time is valuable too, but we
figured the hiring manager would probably underestimate how much time
the recruiter spent since they didn't directly observe it. While
answers were all over the place, the range with the most overlap was
&lt;strong&gt;50-100 hours of engineering time to make a hire&lt;/strong&gt;. No huge revelation
here, but companies make a massive investment in hiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my days being an interviewer at Qualcomm and Amazon as well as a
smaller startup, I'd say fifty hours is on the low side for big company
but about right for a smaller company. When something costs 50+
engineering hours to do, any improvement is worth a lot of time and
money and at Read the Docs we believe we can help significantly here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="top-hiring-channels"&gt;Top hiring channels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was no big surprise to hear that &lt;strong&gt;referrals were the top hiring
channel&lt;/strong&gt;. The second best channel was a bit of a surprise with local
meetups and local communities being very high in a majority of
interviews although this was less true among the largest companies we
talked to. Companies also had some success with recruiting at
conferences, using various job sites, and proactive outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring managers shared strategies with us that they used to increase the
number of referral and community candidates they got. Two different
companies we talked to hosted multiple local meetups at their offices
and one of those hiring managers said "being plugged into the
community" was their main channel for hiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hiring manager who focused a lot on developers with security
experience talked about having "LinkedIn parties" where either a
hiring manager or internal recruiter sat with engineers on their team
one-on-one to go through their LinkedIn network. Even when he heard a
person "is great, but they'll never change jobs", that was a good
candidate to target. Security is such a high demand field, he said, that
very few great people are actively looking for a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2019-job-seeker-timeline.png" class="mw-100" alt="Job seeker timeline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reaching-people-who-arent-looking-is-critical"&gt;Reaching people who aren't looking is critical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our biggest takeaways from the interviews was that companies
wanted to reach candidates before they started actively looking. Most of
the hiring managers we talked to stressed the importance of getting in
front of passive candidates. Certainly fewer people are actively looking
for developer jobs than those who are just open to a change. A few
different reasons were given but I actually think &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/20070501/column-guest.html"&gt;Joel Spolsky had it
right&lt;/a&gt; when he
said top developers "barely ever apply for jobs at all. That's because
they already have jobs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quote isn't necessarily a slight against people who apply actively
to jobs. Virtually everyone I know in tech started their career applying
to a job. Rather, the message here is that as a developer becomes a
mid-level developer and then becomes a senior developer, they are more
likely to rely on their network to somewhat passively job seek rather
than going through the front door and simply applying on a company
website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching people who aren't actively looking is one area where Read the
Docs can really help. Companies want to reach them when they are just
thinking about a new job or perhaps passively seeking. Developers who
come to our site are actively building software, not job-seeking. Many
of them are content at their current position. For those that aren't,
this is a perfect place to showcase great companies and help Read the
Docs' visitors to find their next job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="recruiters-can-be-worth-it"&gt;Recruiters can be worth it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each interview, we asked whether the company used recruiters or
recruiting related services (eg. Hired, Triplebyte). Universally, hiring
managers brought up how expensive recruiters are, but most of the people
we talked to who had actually used recruiters in the past had a positive
impression overall. Hiring takes a ton of time, typically from senior
folks at the company. At smaller startups, that's frequently the CEO or
CTO. Even though the price is high, recruiters who help speed that
process along are worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the quote that really summed it up was from a VP of engineering
at a startup that just raised a Series B. He's trying to grow his team
by 10 developers this year (about a 50% increase). His experience hiring
his first couple developers through a 2-person boutique recruiting firm
was great and he would use them for hiring everyone "if hiring 10
people didn't mean $100k+" in fees alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: &lt;a href="https://triplebyte.com"&gt;Triplebyte&lt;/a&gt; is an advertiser
on Read the Docs. We're fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="diversity-and-inclusivity-in-hiring"&gt;Diversity and inclusivity in hiring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't ask any questions around hiring for diversity but fully six
hiring managers volunteered information on their companies' strategies
for getting more diverse candidates. This is why I love this kind of
interview where the goal is just to listen to what hiring managers say
and dig deeper when you hear something interesting. Some of the larger
companies we talked to had explicit diversity goals set at the company
level. Even among the hiring managers at smaller companies, they shared
some tactics they used to get more diverse candidates to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the companies with hard diversity goals, most of them told us that
their strategy entailed syndicating their job openings to diversity
focused jobs sites or in some cases engaging directly with relevant
interest groups. In terms of efficacy, reviews of these various jobs
boards was mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the more positive side, hiring managers cited Girl Develop It, Black
Girls Code, and PyLadies as fantastic channels for &lt;strong&gt;both increasing
candidate diversity and for high quality applicants&lt;/strong&gt;. Two companies
also talked about trying to decrease bias in their job postings using
&lt;a href="https://textio.com/"&gt;Textio&lt;/a&gt; and similar services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having multiple people mention diversity completely unprompted really
shows that this topic is becoming higher priority for companies and
hiring managers. It also shows that it if hiring for diversity is
important to your company, you need to have a plan for actually making
those goals a reality. It's worth checking whether the strategy
actually works too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="remember-sourcing-is-the-bigger-problem"&gt;Remember, sourcing is the bigger problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single hiring manager we talked to complained about the time they
spent filtering resumes from applicants. Some choice quotes I heard
included "95% of applicants weren't a fit" even after only reviewing
the resume and a hiring manager who posted to a very popular remote-only
job board told me he got "literally one thousand applications". While
I believe this is a legitimate complaint, I think &lt;a href="http://blog.alinelerner.com/building-a-product-in-the-technical-recruiting-space-read-this-first/"&gt;Aline Lerner, founder
of interviewing.io said it
best&lt;/a&gt;
when she said "Engineering hiring isn't a filtering problem. It's a
sourcing problem." The reason we heard it a lot is that filtering is a
very time-consuming task that hiring managers directly deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real problem here is that &lt;strong&gt;the number of applicants to a job post
is a vanity metric&lt;/strong&gt;. What hiring managers are looking for is qualified
applicants, which is harder to gauge without some additional work. One
of the problems here is that a lot of jobs sites make it really easy for
candidates to apply to lots of jobs. This is understandable from their
perspective as more applicants makes their platform seem more valuable.
There's no reason for a job board to put artificial barriers into the
application funnel, but hiring managers told us they want candidates who
want to work for their company not somebody who is applying to every job
out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of building product here, I think hiring managers just need a
few tweaks to get more of a signal of candidate quality and intent in
their applications. A few of the hiring managers we talked to described
how they did this. Multiple hiring managers mentioned how they required
a cover letter that answered specific questions ("why us" was the most
popular). Another hiring manager described how his hiring system just
asked a few short questions of candidates -- for example, "what is the
software project you're most proud of" -- when they applied. When a
candidate didn't do a cover letter or didn't answer the questions,
they weren't considered. The latter solution seemed like the best of
both worlds as it solves the one-click apply problem without being too
much of a barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thanks"&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to thank all the hiring managers who took time out of their
days (or in some cases evenings) to talk to us. If you're a hiring
manager or an internal company recruiter and you'd like to share your
experiences and help Read the Docs, please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@readthedocs.org?subject=Lessons+From+Hiring+Managers+Post"&gt;get in

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the Docs is probably not the first place …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post first appeared
on the &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/hiring-developers-with-readthedocs/"&gt;Read the Docs company blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the Docs is probably not the first place you think of if you are
recruiting. However, over &lt;strong&gt;7 million unique developers use Read the
Docs each month&lt;/strong&gt; from all over the world. We didn't set out to build a
better job board, but after a number of advertisers used our &lt;a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advertising/ethical-advertising.html"&gt;ethical
ads&lt;/a&gt;
for recruiting, we discovered that Read the Docs was a great place to
find developer talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hiring-with-read-the-docs-works"&gt;Hiring with Read the Docs works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers are not always actively job seeking by browsing job boards or
company careers pages. However, they are on Read the Docs reading about
the libraries and frameworks they use. Even when people aren't actively
looking for a new job, many are open to exploring new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Read the Docs, we found that developers engage with hiring ads at a
higher rate than any other kind of advertising. With hiring ads,
developers get ads that are relevant and interesting and companies reach
the folks actively using the tech they are recruiting for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2018-ctr-adtype.png" class="mw-100" alt="Click-through rate by ad type Q3 2018"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="be-specific-and-find-the-right-developers"&gt;Be specific and find the right developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for Python developers, you can configure your hiring
ad to only show on Python related documentation. You can further refine
your audience to Read the Docs visitors in specific regions. Whether you
are looking for a remote Python data scientist or a blockchain developer
in Switzerland, be as specific as possible. This ensures you don't get
unqualified candidates as well as making sure you catch the eyes of the
people you are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="set-the-right-expectations"&gt;Set the right expectations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any type of advertising, setting appropriate expectations can make
the difference between a lackluster and successful campaign. In hiring,
it is even more critical. This means making sure that your hiring ad for
a front-end JavaScript developer links directly to your JavaScript
developer job listing page where people can click "apply". Don't link
to a listing of all of your open positions unless your hiring ad sets
that expectation. Nothing is worse for the developer than clicking on a
hiring ad and not knowing what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, some things can set the wrong kind of expectation. Most
developers have seen enough hiring posts for "rockstars" and
"ninjas" to know what to expect. Be honest and upfront and you will
attract the right folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="stand-out"&gt;Stand out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers get contacted all the time by recruiters and it can be
difficult to show prospective employees why they should check out your
company. People look for all sorts of different things when seeking a
new job from working with a high-caliber team to working for a company
whose goals they agree with. You should highlight your best selling
points right on your hiring ad as early as possible. If your company
affords a fantastic work/life balance, mention that. A company in a
great location, with a beautiful office, and top of the line hardware
should definitely feature that. Focusing on your best attributes shows
you care about your developers and helps you appeal to people who care
about your products and mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you hiring?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/hiring/"&gt;Find qualified candidates&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we shared about the
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2018/05/ads-and-ad-blockers/"&gt;challenge …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post first appeared
on the &lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/ad-blocker-update/"&gt;Read the Docs company blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, we shared about the
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2018/05/ads-and-ad-blockers/"&gt;challenge ad blocking presented to our sustainability&lt;/a&gt;
and what we were doing about it. On May 4th, Read the Docs
was added to the &lt;a href="https://acceptableads.com/"&gt;Acceptable Ads list&lt;/a&gt;
meaning that our visitors running ad blockers who choose to allow
unintrusive advertising will see our ads again. The &lt;strong&gt;impact to our ad
views, clicks, and revenue was immediate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="data-on-our-inclusion-in-the-acceptable-ads-list"&gt;Data on our inclusion in the Acceptable Ads list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2018-readthedocs-adblocker-update.png" class="mw-100" alt="Impact of ad blocking and acceptable ads at Read the Docs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;32% of Read the Docs visitors run an ad blocker&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates around the web vary regarding what percentage of people
run ad blockers and it varies heavily by industry. We discussed this
figure a bit in our
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2018/05/ads-and-ad-blockers/"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;It took a month from application to inclusion in the list&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discovered about our inclusion in the
&lt;a href="https://easylist.to/"&gt;EasyList&lt;/a&gt; ad blocker list within a couple
days and immediately applied to the Acceptable Ads program. No
changes were required of us to meet the &lt;a href="https://acceptableads.com/en/about/criteria"&gt;Acceptable Ads
criteria&lt;/a&gt; and we also
qualified for &lt;a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads#privacy-friendly-acceptable-ads"&gt;Acceptable Ads without third-party
tracking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Eyeo, the company behind AdBlock Plus, derives &lt;a href="https://adblockplus.org/about#monetization"&gt;most of their
revenue&lt;/a&gt; from the
Acceptable Ads initiative by charging large entities, Read the Docs
&lt;strong&gt;did not&lt;/strong&gt; pay for inclusion on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Over half of those running an ad blocker allow acceptable ads&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given our more tech-savvy and privacy-focused audience, we didn't
know what to expect. Not every ad blocker allows acceptable ads by
default and even then users can choose to turn them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;People running ad blockers DO click on ads&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can definitively say this is true of our audience. Our
click-through rate did not change based on ad blocking or our
inclusion in the acceptable ads list at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the ad views and clicks blocked by ad blockers, inclusion in the
Acceptable Ads list meant that 55-60% of our ad-blocking visitors choose
to allow our ads. This directly translated into revenue toward our
sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="building-our-ethical-ads"&gt;Building our Ethical Ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Acceptable Ads list is definitely a step in the right direction for
us. We share the goal of unintrusive advertising that respects our
audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People understand that advertising funds much of the web. As ads got
larger, more annoying, and ad networks stored more information on
millions of people, however, many people finally decided to install ad
blockers.
This is the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/the-graph/how-to-reverse-publisher-revenue-drain-c33e41bf0665"&gt;largest boycott in human
history&lt;/a&gt;
and blaming users isn't the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our experience with ad blocking and the Acceptable Ads list, it
is clear that visitors will allow advertising that doesn't disrupt user
experience and doesn't track people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are glad to have made progress toward regaining our sustaining

&lt;p&gt;Last time, we shared how
&lt;a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2018/04/ethical-advertising-works/"&gt;ethical advertising works&lt;/a&gt;
to keep Read the Docs sustainable without creepy ad
targeting. This time, we will share about one of our biggest challenges
with advertising. At the beginning of April, Read the Docs was added to
one of the most popular ad block lists: the
&lt;a href="https://easylist.to/"&gt;Easylist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ad-blocker-fallout"&gt;Ad blocker fallout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2018-readthedocs-adblocker-fallout.png" class="mw-100" alt="Effect of ad blocking on Read the Docs ad views"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting added to the EasyList had a significant and immediate impact on
the bottom line at Read the Docs. Right around April 1, &lt;strong&gt;32% of our ad
views simply vanished&lt;/strong&gt;. At first, we thought we had done something
horribly wrong but then we discovered that this was due entirely to ad
blocking. Our actual traffic wasn't down at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users' browsers were simply downloading the updated EasyList which
blocked ads on Read the Docs. In terms of ad viewership, weekdays --
our busiest days and the peaks in the graph -- became more like weekends
and weekends fell off a cliff. We had always guessed what percentage of
our user base ran ad blockers. Now we know. We knew this day would come
as we became more successful but we had hoped it was a ways off
considering we weren't part of a large ad network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This directly affected our operations and staff. Our operating costs
didn't go down in any significant way, but revenue sure did.
Advertising is by far the largest source of revenue at Read the Docs and
it just dropped by about a third. This meant that we had to cut some
costs where we could and slow down some hiring plans. While Read the
Docs is not a non-profit company, all the revenue is reinvested into the
project itself, paying maintainers, and other places in the open source
ecosystem. The situation is not dire by any means, but it was certainly
disappointing that we ended up on the same list with popup advertisers
who couldn't care less about privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="all-about-ad-blockers"&gt;All about ad blockers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad blockers fulfill a legitimate need to mitigate the &lt;a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ethical-advertising.html"&gt;significant
downsides of
advertising&lt;/a&gt;
from tracking across the internet, security implications of third-party
code, and impacting the UX and performance of sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Read the Docs, we specifically didn't want those things. That's why
we built the ad network we wanted to exist with only relevant ads and no
creepy behavioral targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://pagefair.com/downloads/2017/01/PageFair-2017-Adblock-Report.pdf"&gt;2017 report from
PageFair&lt;/a&gt;
(pdf), a company that specializes in quantifying ad blocking, 11% of
global web users run an ad blocker. Considering that Read the Docs'
core audience is tech-savvy, privacy-conscious developers, it should be
no surprise that our number is higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-are-we-doing-about-it"&gt;What are we doing about it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be an uphill battle to get back to where we were in terms of
revenue and sustaining Read the Docs, here are a few things we are
working on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We applied to the &lt;a href="https://acceptableads.com/"&gt;acceptable ads&lt;/a&gt; list,
    an ad block list enabled on many ad blockers by default that enables
    some unobtrusive advertising. We are very hopeful here but it does
    take quite a bit longer to get on this list than it does to get
    blocked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nagging users into allowing ads on Read the Docs. We are envisioning
    more of a polite nag in a similar vein to
    &lt;a href="https://jsfiddle.net/"&gt;jsfiddle&lt;/a&gt; rather than an \"adblock wall\"
    which prevents usage of Read the Docs until it's allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogging and raising awareness of how ad blocking affects us and
    other open source projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we could simply change our CSS and ad API to avoid blocking since
we host our ads ourselves, we decided not to engage in a cat and mouse
game since this work would not benefit users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising funds much of the web and many people recognize that while
there are plenty of bad actors in the ad industry -- think pop-under ad
networks or ads that navigate your browser for you -- some advertising
is necessary to power the web we know and love especially when it comes
to open source software which has &lt;a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/"&gt;unique funding
challenges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: On May 4th, Read the Docs was added to the acceptable ads
list! We will collect data over the next couple weeks and have a
follow-up post on what effects this had on advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="open-source-advertising-list"&gt;Open source advertising list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Read the Docs, we also discovered that we are not the only open
source project that got our advertising blocked by ad blockers. Many
open source projects that fund themselves through advertising get
blocked and some of them don't have the resources to navigate the
acceptable ads program or understand the inner workings of ad blockers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, some web users may not want to allow all acceptable ads which
includes many ads from the big networks but we are hoping they would be
willing to accept ads that benefit their community of software
developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are launching a &lt;strong&gt;new initiative&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;a href="https://ads-for-open-source.readthedocs.io"&gt;allow advertising that
benefits open source
software&lt;/a&gt;. We encourage you
to subscribe to the this list and support open source. If you run an
open source project affected by ad blockers, we would love to help you
too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="adblock"></category><category term="readthedocs"></category></entry><entry><title>Ethical Advertising Works</title><link href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2018/04/ethical-advertising-works/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-16T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-04-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Eric Holscher</name></author><id>tag:www.ethicalads.io,2018-04-16:/blog/2018/04/ethical-advertising-works/</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post first appeared

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been two years since we first launched
&lt;a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/ads-on-read-the-docs/"&gt;ads on Read the Docs&lt;/a&gt;.
We figured it was time to report on the results that we've
seen, and say thanks to those who have helped us along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-results"&gt;The Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it simply: &lt;strong&gt;Ethical Advertising works&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Q1 2018, our estimated revenue from advertising is $75,000. This is
enough to fund our small team of 4 people to work on Read the Docs
full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we started building our ethical advertising model, we didn't know
how it would work out. We didn't know much about the ad industry, and
we were doing things different than everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are happy to report that you can build advertising that is a
win/win/win for all parties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Docs wins because we generate revenue, allowing us to
    sustain our operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advertisers win because they are able to reach our audience of
    developers, helping to grow their business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users win because their privacy is maintained, and they continue to
    have access to our service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethical advertising on Read the Docs has not been without its
challenges, which we will cover in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tracking-users-isnt-required"&gt;Tracking users isn't required&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way we've been trying to prove a simple thesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can have successful advertising without tracking our users. So much
of the trouble facing the ad industry these days is because of this
massive databases of user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been able to show that we can show ads without knowing exactly
who our users are. The content they are reading is enough to show them
targeted ads, without knowing anything about them. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not let advertisers run 3rd party code on Read the Docs. Ad
    images and javascript is all hosted by us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not provide advertisers with data dumps, except aggregated
    reports on the clicks and views their ads got.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We target our ads based only on geography and the details of the
    page being visited, not on a profile of the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're now taking a look at what we've learned, and how we might help
more infrastructure projects reach sustainability with an ethical
advertising approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="towards-an-ethical-ad-network"&gt;Towards an Ethical Ad Network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have shown that an advertising business model that respects users
can also sustain critical open source infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; We hope that we
can act as an example for other projects that depend on ads. You can
make money without giving away your users data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers have the power to shift the ad industry to respect user
privacy. We must start with our own projects, leading by example. We
need to have all the ads in the open source ecosystem respect user
privacy, and then we can start to apply pressure to other parts of the
tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We realize that not every open source project can do all the work that
we've done. We want to explore how we can build an &lt;strong&gt;Ethical Ad
Network&lt;/strong&gt;, where user data isn't sent to us, but each project doesn't
need to do ad sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ethical ad network is still in the planning phases, but if you know
a project that might be interested in being a beta tester, please &lt;a href="mailto:ads@readthedocs.org"&gt;get
in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thanks"&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to thank all of companies who have believed in our ethical ads
initiative. You can only sell something if people buy it, and I'd like
to give credit to the folks who have believed in our concept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twilio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sentry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rollbar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mongo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosted Graphite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pyup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triplebyte&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital Impact Alliance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exoscale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nginx&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odoo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircleCI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cherry Servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniregistry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OSCON&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
